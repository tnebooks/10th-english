## 1. His First Flight

The young seagull was alone on his **ledge**. His two brothers and his sister had already flown away the day before. He had been afraid to fly with them. Somehow, when he had taken a little run forward to the brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his wings, he became afraid. The great expanse of sea stretched down beneath, and it was such a long way down – miles down. He felt certain that his wings would never support him; so he bent his head and ran away back to the little hole under the ledge where he slept at night.


Even when each of his brothers and his little sister whose wings were far shorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their wings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage to take that plunge which appeared to him so desperate. His father and mother had come around calling to him shrilly, scolding him, threatening to let him starve on his ledge, unless he flew away. But for the life of him, he could not move.


That was twenty-four hours ago. Since then, nobody had come near him. The day before, all day long, he had watched his parents flying about with his brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art of flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and how to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older brother catch his first **herring** and **devour** it, standing on a rock, while his parents circled around raising a proud **cackle**. And all the morning, the whole family had walked about on the big plateau midway down the opposite cliff, laughing at his cowardice.


The sun was now ascending the sky, blazing warmly on his ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat because he had not eaten since the previous nightfall. Then, he had found a dried piece of **mackerel**’s

tail at the far end of his ledge. Now, there was not a single scrap of food left. He had searched every inch, rooting among the rough, dirt-caked straw nest where
he and his brothers and sister had been hatched. He even **gnawed** at the dried pieces of eggshell. It was like eating a part of himself.


He then **trotted** back and forth from one end of the ledge to the other, his
long gray legs stepping daintily, trying to
find some means of reaching his parents
without having to fly. But on each side
of him, the ledge ended in a sheer fall
of **precipice**, with the sea beneath. And
between him and his parents, there was a
deep, wide crack.

Surely he could reach them without
flying if he could only move northwards
along the cliff face? But then, on what could he walk? There was no ledge, and he
was not a fly. And above him, he could see
nothing. The precipice was sheer, and the
top of it was, perhaps, farther away than
the sea beneath him.

He stepped slowly out to the brink of
the ledge, and, standing on one leg with the
other leg hidden under his wing, he closed
one eye, then the other, and pretended to
be falling asleep. Still, they took no notice
of him. He saw his two brothers and his
sister lying on the plateau dozing, with
their heads sunk into their necks. His
father was **preening** the feathers on his
white back. Only his mother was looking
at him.

She was standing on a little high
hump on the plateau, her white breast
thrust forward. Now and again, she tore at
a piece of fish that lay at her feet, and then
scraped each side of her beak on the rock.
The sight of the food maddened him. How
he loved to tear food that way, scraping
his beak now and again to **whet** it! He
uttered a low cackle. His mother cackled
too, and looked at him.

‘Ga, ga, ga,’ he cried, begging her to
bring him over some food. ‘Gawl-ool-ah,’
she screamed back mockingly. But he kept
calling **plaintively**, and after a minute or
so, he uttered a joyful scream. His mother
had picked up a piece of fish and was
flying across to him with it. He leaned
out eagerly, tapping the rock with his feet,
trying to get nearer to her as she flew
across. But when she was just opposite to
him, abreast of the ledge, she halted, her
legs hanging limp, her wings motionless,
the piece of fish in her beak almost within
reach of his beak.

He waited a moment in surprise,
wondering why she did not come nearer,
and then maddened by hunger, he dived at
the fish. With a loud scream, he fell
outwards and downwards into space. His
mother had **swooped** upwards. As he
passed beneath her, he heard the swish of
her wings.

Then a monstrous terror seized him
and his heart stood still. He could hear
nothing. But it only lasted a moment. The
next moment, he felt his wings spread
outwards. The wind rushed against his
breast feathers, then under his stomach
and against his wings. He could feel the
tips of his wings cutting through the air. 

He was not falling headlong now. He
was soaring gradually, downwards and
outwards. He was no longer afraid. He just
felt a bit dizzy. Then, he flapped his wings
once and he soared upwards.

He uttered a delightful scream and
flapped them again. He soared higher. He
raised his breast and banked against the
wind. ‘Ga, ga, ga. Ga, ga, ga.’ ‘Gawloolah.’ His mother swooped past him, her
wings making a loud noise. He answered
her with another scream. Then, his father
flew over him screaming. Then, he saw his
two brothers and sister flying around him,
soaring and diving.


Then, he completely forgot that he
had not always been able to fly, and
commenced to dive and soar, shrieking
shrilly.

He was near the sea now, flying
straight over it, facing out over the ocean.
He saw a vast green sea beneath him, with
little ridges moving over it; he turned
his beak sideways and crowed amusedly.
His parents and his brothers and sister
had landed on this green floor in front of
him. They were beckoning to him, calling
shrilly. He dropped his legs to stand on
the green sea. His legs sank into it. He
screamed with fright and attempted to
rise again, flapping his wings. But he was
tired and weak with hunger and he could
not rise exhausted by the strange exercise.
His feet sank into the green sea, and then
his belly touched it and he sank no farther. 

He was floating on it. And around him,
his family was screaming, praising him,
and their beaks were offering him scraps
of dog-fish. 

He had made his first flight.

##Reading
**H. Read the following passage and
answer the questions that follow.**

**BUNGEE-JUMPING**

Bungee jumping is an activity that
involves jumping from a tall structure
while connected to a long elastic cord. The
tall structure is usually a fixed object, such
as a building, bridge or crane; but it is also
possible to jump from a movable object,
such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter,
that has the ability to hover above the
ground. The thrill comes from the freefalling and the rebound. When the person
jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper
flies upwards again as the cord recoils, and
continues to oscillate up and down until
all the kinetic energy is dissipated

Jumping Heights, located in Mohan
Chatti village, in Rishikesh has been
rated as one of the most preferred bungee
jumping destinations in India at a height
of 83 meters. It is the only place in India
where bungee jumping can be done from
a fixed platform. This is also India’s only
fixed platform Bungee- performed from a
professional cantilever, to separate it from
entertainment parks, and create instead,
an extreme adventure zone. The Bungee
has been designed by David Allardice of
New Zealand.

The Cantilever platform is built over
a rocky cliff over-looking the river Hall,
a tributary of River Ganges. Bungeeing amidst the vastness of nature lends
an absolutely breath taking experience. 

Jumping Heights is well known for its safety measures and experienced staff. It costs
around Rs 2500 per jump, a bit expensive, but totally worth the experience. The Bungee
jumping experience has been set amidst the astoundingly stunning landscape of Rishikesh.
To Bungee jump, one must be at least 12 years and should weigh between
40-110 kg.

**Questions**
1. What is Bungee Jumping?
2. Can Bungee be performed from a movable object? How?
3. When do you think Bungee becomes thrilling?
4. What is the experience when one falls off the platform?
5. Where is the Bungee jumping point located in India?
6. What is the minimum age to Bungee jump?

begin the sentence with ‘You are requested

negative form, the request in passive voice
should begin with ‘You are requested not
to’.

the ground. (Passive)

2. Please do not use mobile phones
here. (Active)
You are requested not to use mobile

Passive Voice – Advice
When we change an advice from
active to passive voice, we should begin
the sentence with ‘You are advised to’. If
the advice is in negative form, it should
begin with ‘You are advised not to’.

**(e.g.)** 1. Work hard (Active)
You are advised to work hard.
(Passive)
2. Do not eat junk food. (Active)
You are advised not to eat junk
food. (Passive)

Passive Voice – Omitting the agent
In the sentences beginning with
someone/no one, omit the ‘agent’ (subject)
in the passive voice.
**(e.g.)** 1. Somebody has taken away my
book. (Active)
My book has been taken away.
(Passive)

2. No one has bought the tickets.
(Active)
The tickets have not been bought.
(Passive)
(Add ‘not’ to the verb for nobody,
none, no one)

When sentences are changed to
Passive, they begin with a verb (in ‘Yes/
No’ questions) or with a question word
followed by the verb (in ‘Wh’ questions).

**a. Questions beginning with Auxiliary
verbs**

**(e.g.)** 1. Did he write a letter? (Active)
