##Zigzag

The family that
shelters a new pet is
totally taken up by the
commotions it creates at
home. Read on the story
to find out there is a turn
of events when they get to know the reality 

Dr. Ashok T. Krishnan’s clinic usually
sounded more like an ancient Chinese
torture chamber than a child specialist’s
clinic. This was because the tiny children
who were his patients left out a variety
of blood –curdling yells and ear-splitting
sobs.

‘It’s all because my patients were
making so much noise and crying so loudly,
‘ he apologized to his wife one evening,
‘that Somu couldn’t hear me properly. He
rang me in the clinic to ask whether we
could keep Zigzag with us when he leaves
for Alaska. And now Somu thinks I said
“yes”, even though I clearly said “no” ! I
know you are busy getting your painting
ready for your exhibition next w…

‘Zigzag!’ interrupted their nine-yearold daughter Maya. 

Isn’t that Uncle Somu’s prized giant
green-and -gold fighting beetle. The one
that spits deadly poison straight into its
opponent’s eye?’

‘No , no,’ corrected her older brother
Arvind, eyes shining in pure delight.
‘The beetle is called Spitfire. Zigzag must 
be Uncle Somu’s pet snake. The African
sidewinder! You know, the one that slithers
Zigzag all over his house!’

‘You’re both quite mistaken,’ their
father hastened to explain, seeing his
wife’s horrified expression. ‘Zigzag is a
most harmless, unusual and lovable bird.
Apparently, it was bred by a genuine
African witch doctor, who gifted it to Somu
when he-------being a child specialist like
me -----------cured the witch doctor’s son
while he was touring the deepest jungles
of equatorial Africa last month. Somu
says the bird is an absolute treasure and a
real help. It’s his favourite pet, you know’.

Somu might be your best friend,
but most of these so called “favourite”
possessions that he has given us were
absolute nuisances!’ countered Mrs.
Krishnan angrily. A talented artist, she
applied a dab of yellow-ochre paint onto
her painting titled Sunset at Marina,
paused for a moment to survey the effect
and then continued, ‘Remember the rare
insect-eating plant he brought back from
the wettest corner of the Amazonian
rainforest! He insisted that we keep it
because it would eat the mosquitoes in
the house and now that wretched plant
requires a room heater to keep it alive in
Chennai!’

‘Ma!’ protested Arvind, ‘That’s not
really true. Uncle Somu’s given us some
really fabulous gifts.’

‘Right! Remember the tiny penknife
he gave me last year, the one with a
genuine shark’s tooth blade. That’s been
really useful,’ Maya joined the protest.

‘No one but you, Maya,’ Mrs.Krishnan
told her daughter sternly,‘would describe
a penknife that has cut open the pockets
of three skirts and two pairs of jeans as
really useful.’

‘And what about the aboriginal
boomerang Uncle Somu brought us all the
way from Australia?’ demanded Arvind.
‘You can’t deny that it was a great hit with
everyone.’

‘Great hit indeed!’ Mrs.Krishnan
didn’t bother to hide her sarcasm
and continued, ‘Considering that the
boomerang sliced through all the TV
aerials in the neighbourhood, caused
permanent damage to several cars in
the parking lot, and knocked out our
watchman cold, with the force you threw
it.’

But Zigzag is different. Somu says
we are sure to love Zigzag,’ soothed
Dr.Krishnan, ‘because the bird can talk
and sing in about twenty-one different
languages - mostly African languages, of
course. When it sings, it moves the listeners
to tears.’

‘It’s Somu’s thoughtless ways that
reduce me to tears!’ Mrs.Krishnan said
irritably. ‘What a time to dump this
multilingual, talking-singing bird on us.
Here I’m tied up in knots trying to get my
paintings together for the exhibition next
week.

‘May I take Zigzag to school, Papa?’
Arvind, as always, was planning ahead.
‘I want to display him in the science
exhibition.’ 

‘When is Zigzag coming, Papa?’ Maya
was jumping up and down, all excited.

‘Uncle Somu said he would send
Zigzag with his old cook, Visu, sometime
today. I’ll have to leave for my clinic now.
There,’ he added as the doorbell rang,
‘that’s probably them!’ 

And indeed it was!

‘Come in, Zigzag, come in, dear!’
coaxedVisu, and in tottered the strangest,
weirdest-looking bird the Krishnan family
had ever seen.

About a foot and a half tall, its
bald head was fringed with a crown of
shocking pink feathers while the rest of
its plumage was in various shades of the
muddiest sludgiest brown. Its curved beak
was sunflower-yellow and its eyes were
the colour of cola held to sunlight.

‘This is Zigzag! Announced Visu
with a flourish. ‘His full name is ZiggyZagga-king-of-the-Tonga. How I’m going
to miss him! So beautifully he talks! He
can even recite French Poetry!’

The object of all this praise was
standing cool and unmoved, with an
expression of almost-human grumpiness
in his cola-coloured eyes.

Arvind, finding that Zigzag was
sulkily refusing to say a word despite all 

their efforts at striking a conversation,
dashed into the kitchen to return with a
plate heaped hurriedly with juicy fruit
slices and some nuts.

Bored eyes brightened momentarily
as Zigzag picked up a walnut. But refusing
to speak, he dropped one wrinkled eyelid
in a solemn wink and flew clumsily
to deposit the nut on the enormous
chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Bit
by bit, and in total silence, all the fruit on
the plate was transferred to the chandelier
and on to the blades of the ceiling fan
(now switched off).

Then perching comfortably on a
curtain rod, Zigzag dropped one wizened
eyelid in another solemn wink as he sank
his beak into a plump guava.

‘Don’t worry, children,’ Visu
comforted as he left, noticing how
disappointed they looked when Zigzag
stubbornly refused to say a single word to
them even though they tried speaking to
him in English, Hindi, Tamil and French.
‘Just wait till Zigzag settles down in this
new home, they you can have a great time
listening to him.’

As it happened, the children didn’t
have to wait more than ten minutes to
have a great time listening to Zigzag. For
as soon as Visu left, Zigzag, still perched
on the curtain rod, went off to sleep. And
the moment he fell asleep, he began to
SNORE!

And what a snore it was
Kngrrwheeze!!! It began as a soft
grumbly sort of rumble, much like that 

which the stomach of a mildly hungry
dinosaur might have made. Then it grew
louder, and louder, and LOUDER until
it sounded as if a herd of elephants with
cold was trumpeting angrily in the room.
KNGRRDRRWHEEZE!!!

Zigzag’s snore pounded their
eardrums till their heads ached.

In vain did they try to wake the
snoring bird. ‘Twenty-one languages, he’s
supposed to know!’ snorted Mrs.Krishnan.
‘Yet this bird chooses to communicate only
in snorish, snorese, snorian, snorihili,
snoralu…’

‘I thought it was scientific fact that
birds couldn’t snore,’ said Maya, trying to
squirt water from a small water pistol at
Zigzag to wake him and wetting most of
the curtains, the walls and a sofa instead.

‘African witch doctor’s birds don’t
obey scientific rules.’ Arvind was annoyed
that his best imitations of a raging lion,
a hungry hyena and a ferocious dog had
failed to draw Zigzag out of his deep
slumber. Now he tried his loudest, most
frightening coyote call.

But Zigzag slept on undisturbed.
And snored on.

In total despair at their failure to
wake Zigzag, or at least stop him snoring,
they shut themselves in the bedroom that
was furthest away from Mrs.Krishnan’s
studio where Zigzag was creating the
terrible din. Mrs.Krishnan was just
unraveling a roll of cotton wool to stuff in
her ears, when they heard their maid, 

Lakshmi, shrieking as if she had been
electrocuted.

Hearts hammering, they rushed to
the studio to find Lakshmi dancing and
clapping her hands excitedly as she yelled,
‘We’ ve been blessed! We’ve been truly
blessed! It’s raining papayas and bananas
in this room!’

They froze in horror. Lakshmi had
apparently switched on the fan on which
Zigzag had left some fruit and nuts.
Half-pecked fruit streamed off the fan,
dampening even Lakshmi’s enthusiasm as
a guava landed on her cheek with a soft
squish and one walnut hit her forehead
with a loud smack. One slice of overripe papaya came whizzing off the fan
and, as they watched it helplessly, it oh
horrors splattered all over Mrs.Krishnan’s
unfinished masterpiece, sunset at Marina,
spreading streaks of gooey orange pulp
and shiny black seeds all over it.

Mrs.Krishnan groaned tragically and
looked ready to shoot Zigzag, but he was
saved by the bell. The telephone bell! They
answered one call after another as all the
neighbours rang upto demand what the
awful KNGRRDRRWHEEZE sound was 
and if they could please have some peace.

And through all this commotion, Zigzag
slept on unconcerned. And snored on.

Finally, an exhausted Mrs.Krishnan
rang up her husband. I’am going crazy
with the sound of Zigzag snoring, plus
all these angry telephone calls. And my
beautiful painting…’ Here her voice
cracked. ‘You know Mrs.Jhunjhunwala,
the art critic who lives upstairs, well, she
heard Zigzag snoring and had the cheek
to telephone and ask me whether I could
sing a little softly when I took my singing
lessons. Please contact Somu and find out
what we should do.’

Dr.Krishnan came home as fast as he
could after he had left an e-mail message
for Somu, asking him for clear instructions
on how to stop Zigzag from snoring.’

‘Don’t worry,’ he reassured his
downcast family. ‘Somu will reply soon
and we’ll discover there’s some ridiculously
simple way to stop Zigzag from snoring.

Six days passed. Six frantic days of
checking their e-mail day and night. Six
torturous days of having the deafeningly
loud KNGRRDRRWHEEZE resound in
their home, most nerve wrackingly. Maya
complained that she heard a permanent
rumbling sound in her ears even when she
was miles away from home and that her
ears ached all the time. Arvind confessed
that, for the first time in his life, he was
actually looking forward to going to
school considering it was as calm as a
monastery compared to their house. Mrs.
Krishnan had lost interest in painting. 

Zigzag would sometimes wake up briefly
when he wanted to eat some fruit, and
sometimes he would sit on the veranda
looking sulky and bored as he stared at the
Sunset at Marina beach- the real view, not
the painting lying forlorn in one corner,
ruined by streaks of hardening papaya.
Zigzag never spoke to anyone, though
everyone tried several times, and in
several languages, to speak to him kindly.
He only slept. And snored.

On the seventh day, Dr.Somu’s e-mail
arrived. It was, as Dr.Krishnan predicted,
ridiculously simple. It read:

‘That does it,’ said Mrs.Krishnan.
‘Find Visu! I will not keep Zigzag here
another minute!’

‘Calm down, dear, I’m leaving for my
clinic now. Can’t it wait till…

‘No, it’s now!’ Mrs.Krishnan was
adamant. ‘I’ve invited some friends and
are experts to come home and choose
my paintings for the exhibition. This
feathered, snoring monster will drive us
all mad!’

‘Come on then, Zigzag,’ called
Dr.Krishnan nervously, wondering how
he would locate Somu’s cook, Visu.

‘Er, why don’t you wait in the car,
Zigzag?’ he suggested. When they reached
his clinic, his heart sinking at the thought
of Zigzag’s ear-shatteringly loud snore
adding to the din of the sobs and shrieks
produced by the tiny patients waiting for
him.

But Ziggy-Zagga-King-of-the-Tonga
was not accustomed to being kept waiting
and was already making his way to the
clinic where he perched himself on the
nurse’s reception table.

‘Don’t you dare sleep!’ Dr.Krishnan
warned Zigzag fiercely as he went towards
his room.

He had hardly walked through the
swinging half-door that separated his
clinic from the waiting room when he
heard a strange voice say, ‘You there in the
blue T-shirt, don’t jump on the sofa. And
you in the red dress, don’t swing on the
curtain.’

It was Zigzag’s voice, clear and
commanding. There was pin-drop silence
in the room as everyone waited, openmouthed, for Zigzag’s next sentence.

Dr.Krishnan was amazed! Gone was
Zigzag’s bored and grumpy expression.
Instead the bird looked happy and alert as
it went about the job it had been trained
for, first with the African witch doctor and
then with Dr.Somu. Dr.Krishnan’s clinic,
usually a noisy sea of tears and tantrums,
was transformed into a calm, orderly 

place as Zigzag efficiently soothed the
frightened patients, scolded the naughty
ones and made the crying ones smile. And
if his yam-digging song and recitation of
French poetry reduced the children to
helpless laughter instead of tears, he didn’t
look as though he minded. And best of all,
Zigzag never slept. Or snored. Even for a
second!

Never had a morning passed so
quietly and peacefully for Dr.Krishnan.
When the last patient had left, he called
Zigzag to his room. Zigzag flew in and sat
on the table. Scratching the bird under its
beak, Dr.Krishnan sighed and said, ‘Somu
was right, after all. You are an absolute
treasure. I never realized what he meant
when he called you a great help. Why
didn’t you tell me you’d prefer to be at my
clinic instead of snoring like that to show
you were bored? What do we do now? No
one wants you back at home now; they
want me to leave you with Visu.’

Just then the telephone rang. It was
Mrs.Krishnan, sounding very pleased with
herself. ‘You know Mrs.Jhunjhunwala,
the art critic?’ she chuckled. ‘She doesn’t
want me to exhibit sunset at marina. She’s
bought it for herself, for ₹ 5,000!’

Isn’t that the painting the papaya fell
on …..? 

‘Yes.’ Mrs.Krishnan was laughing
heartily now. I had left it in one corner
and she chose to buy it, saying she loved
my new technique of painting! She simply
adored those streaky orangey bits! She
launched into fresh gales of laughter. ‘By
the way,’ she said when she sobered down,
‘I don’t think we were fair to Zigzag. Shall we keep him with us at home, just on trial
for another week?’

‘Sure!’, agreed a delighted
Dr.Krishnan before he cleverly added.
‘And I could always take him to the clinic
every morning so that you can paint in
peace at home.’

‘My boy!’ he confided to Zigzag after
matters were satisfactorily settled, giving the
bird a toffee from his desk. ‘You have your
own strange way of showing your genius. A
Zigzag way, I’d call it, wouldn’t you?’

But Ziggy - Zagga - King - of - the
-Tonga, brought up on compliments as he
was, didn’t bother to reply. He just ate the
toffee, paper wrapper and all, and then
lowered one crinkly eyelid in a knowing
wink.
