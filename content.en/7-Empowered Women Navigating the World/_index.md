##Empowered Women Navigating the World

Gone are the days, where women in
India remained indoors unless permitted
to go out with an escort. Conditions today
have changed, thanks to all those women
who have fought for their freedom and set
a very good example for others. The real
power of women though realised earlier,
is currently being projected to the world
by the advancement of technology and
media.

Women occupy almost all the major
positions in society. Currently, women’s
accomplishments are tremendous in
many fields. One such achievement is
the All-women Indian Navy crew who
circumnavigated the world for 254 days
all alone, in a sailboat called INSV Tarini.

**What is INSV Tarini?**

INSV stands for Indian Naval Ship
Vessel. Tara-Tarini is the patron deity for
sailors and is worshipped for safety and
success at sea.

INSV Tarini is the second sailboat of
the Indian Navy (The first being the INSV
Mhadei). It is a 55 foot sailing vessel built
indigenously in India by M/s Aquarius
Shipyard Pvt. Ltd, located in Goa. After
undergoing extensive sea trials, she was
commissioned to the Indian Navy service
on 18 February 2017. The boat was named
after the famous ‘Tara-Tarini’ temple in
Ganjam district of Odisha. The word
‘Tarini’ means ‘boat’ and in Sanskrit it
means ‘Saviour’.

INSV Tarini has an advanced
Raymarine navigation suite and an array
of satellite communication systems for
perfect navigation anywhere in world.

**Navika Sagar Parikrama** was a
project undertaken in consonance with
the National policy to empower women
to attain their full potential. “The Project
is considered essential towards promoting
ocean sailing activities in the Navy while
depicting Government of India’s thrust for
Nari Shakti (women power),” said Chief
of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sunil Lanba in
his welcome speech.

The voyage was aimed to showcase
‘Make in India’ initiative by sailing onboard indigenously built INSV Tarini.
The special feature of this sailboat was
that it encouraged the use of environment
friendly non-conventional renewable
energy resources such as the wind;
collected and updated meteorological,
ocean and wave data on regular basis
for accurate weather forecast by India
Meteorological Department (IMD) and
also collected data for monitoring marine
pollution on high seas.

**Indian Navy’s Six Women Crew**

Indian Navy’s all-women crew was
the first-ever to circumnavigate the globe
skippered by Lt. Cdr Vartika Joshi. The
all-women team has also Lt. Cdr. Pratibh
Jamwal, Lt. Cdr. **Swathi P**atarapalli,
Lt. Aishwarya Boddapati, Lt. Vijaya Devi
and Lt. Payal Gupta as its crew members. 

The crew started their voyage on 10
September 2017 from Goa, flagged off by
the Defence Minister of India. It was a
historic day, which would be marked in
navigation history and globally. It covered
the expedition in five legs with stopovers at four ports (Fremantle, Australia;
Lyttleton, New Zealand; Port Stanley, the
Falklands and Cape Town, South Africa)
for replenishment of ration and repair
as necessary, before returning to Goa in
April 2018. They went around the globe
within 254-days and reached Goa port
on 21 May 2018. The six member women crew broke many stereotypes during their
record-setting sail.

**An Interview with the crew members**

India’s all-women navy crew who
went around the world in 254-days have
shared their experiences about their great
voyage in an interview. Through their
personal experiences, we really come to
know their hardships and unpredictable
challenges they have faced all through their
expeditions.

Interviewer: How well were you
acquainted with the sail boat before you
took up the task?

Vartika Joshi: None of us was
acquainted with a sail boat or ocean-going
boat; none of us had sailed before, nor are
woman officers allowed entry in combat
platforms as yet. At first, it was difficult
to take the boat out to sea, from one point
to another. But we slowly built upon it
through three years of training.

Interviewer: Can you tell us about
the training you had undergone before
this expedition?

Vartika Joshi: We started with
some theoretical courses on navigation,
communication and weather prediction.
Classroom courses are different from
sailing outside. So, we were given hands-on
training, like, how to repair things and how
to deal with emergencies, when the weather
gets rough, if there is a medical emergency,
and training was needed in tactical aspects
as well.

Aishwarya: We underwent our basic
sail training courses in Mumbai at the
Indian Naval Waterman ship Training
Centre (INWTC), and at various schools in
the southern naval base in Kochi. We even
sailed on INSV Mhadei to Mauritius (in
2016 and 2017) and back and also to Cape
Town in December 2016. We were trained
for almost three years to prepare for the
voyage. Since the boat was old, it had minor
leaks and repairs. Also, we ran out of water
and food soon. So the trip was a tutorial for
us on how to manage food, water and even
electricity during the big voyage.

Interviewer: What was the selection
process? 

Aishwarya: Out of the thirty women
who had applied, six of us were shortlisted,
based on the little survival skills we
showcased. The crew was mentored by
Commander Dilip Donde. But after I was
told about the flare-ups at sea, I even had
second thoughts about joining the team.

Interviewer: How did your family
members react when you told them about
this expedition? 

Vartika Joshi: Our families did have
a hard time, but that was because most of
them had never even seen the sea! Four
of us are from the mountains. The first
time my parents saw the ocean was when I
invited them to visit. But once they saw that
we’re doing well and looking after ourselves,
they were quite supportive. They were
apprehensive and supportive too.

Interviewer: What were your aims and
how did you work to achieve them?

 Vartika Joshi: I wanted to make sure
that I complete this journey with ultimate
honesty. I didn’t set out for a destination;
it was the journey that mattered to me the
most. So my contention was to make sure
that we go by the rules of circumnavigation
which say that you don’t have to use any
auxiliary means of repulsion and you don’t
have to take anybody else’s assistance. I
grasped that completely. 

Interviewer: Name that one quality of
yours that enabled you to complete this
expedition successfully? 

Vartika Joshi: Whenever the winds
dropped, it wouldn’t have taken me even a
fraction of second to switch on the engine
and say let’s go one mile ahead. But inside
of me something poked me and said
that you have to be honest with yourself
and this expedition has to be done with
honesty. I am glad that we were able to
finish it successfully without the use of
the engine at all.

Interviewer: As the head of the crew,
how did you involve the team?

Vartika Joshi: We’ve all sailed and
trained the same amount, and everybody
has their own way of dealing with
situations, but that was a good thing, 
because we could discuss different ways
of solving a problem and choose the best
one. In fact, I’d say it was easier for us to
collaborate and work together.

Payal Gupta: When you are out at
sea, teamwork is the most important in
the middle of the crisis. Even during the
storm when three people would be out on
watch, the other three who would be inside
wouldn’t be able to rest. Somebody would
heat the water, the other person would heat
the gloves because it was raining also. So
team effort actually helped in navigating
through the 20 hours long storm. I feel that
if I had been alone then it would have been
a nightmare to deal with the challenges
that the sea throws at you

Interviewer: Share your experience about
the most challenging task while sailing.

Vartika Joshi: The Sea can get really
tough when winds are picking up. Those
are the times we have to be active and need
to anticipate what could be there ahead. In
the South Pacific, we encountered a storm
where the seas were almost nine to ten
meters high and the winds were picking up
to 60–70 knots(a unit of speed equal to one
nautical mile per hour exactly 1.852km/h),
which is about a hurricane force of wind
on land. It is normal on sea where there is
hardly any land mass to stop the winds.

It was also a blissful experience when
something broke down and after a lot of
hard work and effort, we were able to fix it
together. We will remember these incidents
as well because they gave us the strength
to move on and if something went bad, we
were able to overcome those challenges. 

Interviewer: What were the exciting
moments during the trip?

Vartika Joshi: When we were
crossing the Tasman Sea, we witnessed the
brilliant Southern Lights from sea. It was
rare to watch that in those months, that too
from sea. We were absolutely awestruck
as we were not expecting it, to see the
entire sky lit up in green light. There was
bio-luminescence, dolphins swimming in
the wake of the boat like our neighbours
and a variety of sea creatures. We spotted
a dead sperm whale once and we thought
it was an island from a distance, it was so
huge. We are not specialists, so whenever
we spotted something in the sea, we had to
Google it to learn more about the species.

Interviewer: How did your crew spend
time deep in the sea?

**Swathi P**: During circumnavigation,
we picked up some hobbies and kept
posting pictures of delicacies like golgappas
and cakes. We also read books when the
weather was pleasant and did some quilling
and craft work. While team leader Joshi
read comics and the Ramayana during
her journey, I loved cooking as well so I
indulged in baking. I also liked crafting a
lot, so I used to make lampshades. I love
it when people appreciate the food that I
cook, so I gave my crew members the best
dishes that was possible on land with the
limited resources that we had on the boat.

Vartika Joshi: Six is a great number,
we were always entertained. We watched
movies, listened to music, and you won’t
believe some of the goodies the crew
rustled up in our tiny pantry, even while
sailing in rough seas. We made parathas, 
baked cakes and breads, and even made
halwa and rasgullas!

We celebrated festivals at sea.
When we think about it now on land, we
remember the Diwali we spent at sea. We
celebrated three birthdays including the
first birthday of the boat; also specific
occasions like crossing the equator, the
International Date Line and such. 

Interviewer: What motivated you to
fulfil the country’s expectations? 

**Swathi P**: We knew that the entire
country was watching us and praying for
us, so we never wanted them to have a
single day thinking that we are in trouble.
We knew that it is going to happen but
the people out there did not know what
kind of challenges we were facing. So, one
of the motives that we kept in mind was
that we did not want to frighten them. We
decided that once the circumnavigating
was over, we are going to show what we
have actually gone through.

Interviewer: As a woman, how would
you consider this expedition?

Vartika Joshi: It is a matter of great
honour and we couldn’t have imagined
anything better for our cast-off. Of course
we being an all-woman team, it is a great
boost to women in the country. But, as we
are going as sailors, and we as sailors have
seen that the sea does not discriminate
between genders. It is always genderneutral and we have realised that gender
does not play a role in sailing. But to boost
the morale in the country and for more
women to take in adventures like sailing, I
feel it is great that an all-woman team had
been formed to undergo this expedition.

**Idioms and Phrases**

**Idioms** are groups of words put
together as a unit with a particular
meaning. The meaning of the word is
not literal. **For example**, if one says that
**the cat is out of the bag** then it **does not
literally mean** the cat is out of the bag **but**
it has a **figurative meaning** which means
**the secret is out.** That’s why the meaning
of idioms cannot be assumed based on the
individual meaning of the words but by
studying the words as a unit.

**Examples**

1. Lalitha takes a late night walk in the
beach **once in a blue moon.**

In the above sentence **‘once in a blue
moon’** is an idiom which means **an event
that happens rarely.** 

2. The women cricketers were **on the ball**
in their last over of the match. 

In the above sentence **‘on the ball’**
is an idiom which means **when someone**
**understands the situations well.**

**A Phrase**, on the other hand, is a
small group of words put together as
a conceptual unit. It **does not take a
figurative meaning.** The meaning of the
word is **literal.** It can be long or short
but it does not include the subject-verb
pairing, necessary to make a clause. **For
example,** ‘looking stunning’; to live and
breathe’; ‘comfortable bed’.

**Example**
1. Next week, Prasanth has planned to
**visit the countryside.** In the above
sentence, **to visit the countryside** is a
**phrase** with the conceptual meaning of
going on a visit to the countryside.
2. The child hid **under the stairs** when the mother called her for a bath.

In the above sentence, under the
stairs is a phrase.

A **Phrasal verb** is an **idiomatic phrase**
consisting of a **verb** and **another element,**
typically an adverb or a preposition or
both, the meaning of which is different
from the meaning of its separate parts. For
example **see to,** or a combination of both,
such as **look down on.**
**Example**
1. The crew **ran out** of water and food
before they could complete their
expedition.

In the above sentence, **ran out** is a
**phrasal verb** which means **to use
completely.**

2. The Police personnel instructed the
mob to **go away** from the place during
the strike.
In the above sentence, **go away** is a
**phrasal verb** which means **to leave**
from the place.
