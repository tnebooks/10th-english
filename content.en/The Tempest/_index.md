##The Tempest
There was an island in the sea, the
only inhabitants of which were an old
man, named Prospero, and his daughter
Miranda, a very beautiful young lady.
She came to this island so young, that she
had no memory of having seen any other
human face than her father’s.


They lived in a cave made out
of a rock; it was divided into several
apartments, one of which Prospero called
his study; there he kept his books, which
chiefly treated of magic. By virtue of his
art, he had released many good spirits
from a witch called Sycorax who had
them imprisoned in the bodies of large
trees. These gentle spirits were ever after
obedient to the will of Prospero. Of these
Ariel was the chief.

With the help of these spirits,
Prospero could command the winds, and
the waves of the sea. By his orders they
raised a violent storm, in the midst of
which, he showed his daughter a fine large
ship, which he told her was full of living
beings like themselves. “Oh my dear 

father,” said she, “if by
your art you have raised
this dreadful storm, have
pity on their sad distress.
See! the vessel will be
dashed to pieces. Poor
souls! they will all perish.”

“Be not so amazed, daughter
Miranda,” said Prospero; “there is no
harm done. I have so ordered it, that no
person in the ship shall receive any hurt.
What I have done has been in care of you,
my dear child. You are ignorant. Can you
remember a time before you came to this
cell? I think you cannot, for you were not
then three years of age.”

“Twelve years ago, Miranda,”
continued Prospero, “I was Duke of Milan,
and you were a princess, and my only heir.
I had a younger brother, whose name was
Antonio, to whom I trusted everything;
My brother Antonio being thus in
possession of my power, began to think
himself the duke indeed. The opportunity
I gave him of making himself popular
among my subjects awakened in his bad
nature a proud ambition to deprive me of
my dukedom: this he soon effected with
the aid of the King of Naples, a powerful
prince, who was my enemy.”

“Wherefore,” said Miranda, “did they
not that hour destroy us?”

“My child,” answered her father,
“they dared not, so dear was the love that
my people bore me. Antonio carried us
on board a ship, and when we were some
leagues out at sea, he forced us into a small
boat, without either tackle, sail, or mast:
there he left us, as he thought, to perish.
But a kind lord of my court, one Gonzalo,
who loved me, had privately placed in the
boat, water, provisions, apparel, and some
books which I prize above my dukedom.”

“O my father,” said Miranda, “what a
trouble must I have been to you then!”

“No, my love,” said Prospero, “you
were a little angel that did preserve me.
Your innocent smiles made me bear up
against my misfortunes. Our food lasted
till we landed on this desert island, since
when my chief delight has been in teaching
you, Miranda, and well have you profited
by my instructions.”


“Heaven thank you, my dear father,” said Miranda. “Now tell me, sir, your reason for raising this sea-storm?”

Having so said, Prospero gently
touched his daughter with his magic wand,
and she fell fast asleep; for the spirit Ariel
just then presented himself before his
master, to give an account of the tempest,
and how he had disposed of the ship’s
company, and though the spirits were
always invisible to Miranda, Prospero did
not choose she should hear him holding
conversation (as would seem to her) with
the empty air.

“Well, my brave spirit,” said Prospero
to Ariel, “how have you performed your
task?”

Ariel gave a lively description of the
storm, and of the terrors of the mariners;
and how the king’s son, Ferdinand, was
the first who leaped into the sea; and
his father thought he saw his dear son
swallowed up by the waves and lost. “But
he is safe,” said Ariel, “in a corner of the
isle, sadly lamenting the loss of the king,
his father.
 
“That’s my delicate Ariel,” said
Prospero. “Bring him here: my daughter
must see this young prince. Where is the
king, and my brother?”

“I left them,” answered Ariel,
“searching for Ferdinand, whom they have
little hopes of finding, thinking they saw him perish. Of the ship’s crew not one is
missing; though each one thinks himself
the only one saved: and the ship, though
invisible to them, is safe in the harbour.”

Ariel then went to fetch Ferdinand.

“O my young gentleman,” said Ariel,
when he saw him, “I will soon move you.
You must be brought, I find, for the Lady
Miranda to have a sight of your pretty
person. Come, sir, follow me.”

He followed in amazement the sound
of Ariel’s voice, till it led him to Prospero
and Miranda, who were sitting under the
shade of a large tree. Now Miranda had
never seen a man before, except her own
father.

Miranda,” said Prospero, “tell me
what you are looking at yonder.”

“O father,” said Miranda, in a strange
surprise, “surely that is a spirit. Lord! How
it looks about! Believe me, it is a beautiful
creature. Is it not a spirit?”

“No, girl,” answered her father; “it
eats, and sleeps, and has senses such as we
have. This young man you see was in the
ship. He is somewhat altered by grief, or
you might call him a handsome person. He
has lost his companions, and is wandering
about to find them.”

Miranda, who thought all men had
grave faces and grey beards like her father,
was delighted with the appearance of this
beautiful young prince; and Ferdinand,
seeing such a lovely lady in this desert
place, and from the strange sounds he had
heard, expecting nothing but wonders, thought he was upon an enchanted island,
and that Miranda was the goddess of the
place, and as such he began to address her.

She timidly answered, she was no
goddess, but a simple maid, and was
going to give him an account of herself,
when Prospero interrupted her. He was
well pleased to find they admired each
other, but to try Ferdinand’s constancy,
he resolved to throw some difficulties in
their way: therefore advancing forward,
he addressed the prince with a stern air,
telling him, he came to the island as a spy,
to take it from him who was the lord of
it. “Follow me,” said he, “I will tie your
neck and feet together. You shall drink
sea-water; shell-fish, withered roots, and
husks of acorns shall be your food.” “No,”
said Ferdinand, “I will resist this” and
drew his sword; but Prospero, waving his
magic wand, fixed him to the spot where
he stood, so that he had no power to move.

Miranda hung upon her father,
saying, “Why are you so ungentle? Have
pity, sir; I will be his surety. This is the
second man I ever saw, and to me he seems
a true one.”

“Silence,” said the father: “one word
more will make me chide you, girl! What!
An advocate for an impostor! You think
there are no more such fine men, having
seen only him and Caliban.” This he said
to prove his daughter’s constancy; and she
replied, “My affections are most humble. I
have no wish to see a goodlier man.”

“Come on, young man,” said
Prospero to the Prince; “you have no
power to disobey me.

Prospero had commanded Ferdinand
to pile up some heavy logs of wood. Kings’
sons not being much used to laborious
work, Miranda soon after found him
almost dying with fatigue. “Alas!” said she,
“do not work so hard; my father is at his
studies, he is safe for these three hours;
pray rest yourself.”

“O my dear lady,” said Ferdinand, “I
dare not. I must finish my task before I
take my rest.”

“If you will sit down,” said Miranda,
“I will carry your logs the while.” But
this Ferdinand would by no means agree
to. 

Prospero, who had enjoined
Ferdinand this task merely as a trial of his
love, was not at his books, as his daughter
supposed, but was standing by them
invisible, to overhear what they said.

Ferdinand inquired her name, which
she told, saying it was against her father’s
express command she did so.

And then Ferdinand, in a fine long
speech, told the innocent Miranda he was
heir to the crown of Naples, and that she
should be his queen.

Prospero then appeared before them.

“Fear nothing, my child,” said he; “I
have overheard, and approve of all you
have said. And, Ferdinand, if I have too
severely used you, I will make you rich
amends, by giving you my daughter as
your wife in future. All your vexations
were but trials of your love, and you have
nobly stood the test. 

When Prospero left them, he called
his spirit Ariel, who quickly appeared
before him, eager to relate what he had
done with Prospero’s brother and the
King of Naples. Ariel said he had left them
almost out of their senses with fear, at the
strange things he had caused them to see
and hear. When fatigued with wandering
about, and famished for want of food, he
had suddenly set before them a delicious
banquet, and then, just as they were going
to eat, he appeared visible before them in
the shape of a harpy, a voracious monster
with wings, and the feast vanished away.
Then, to their utter amazement, this
seeming harpy spoke to them, reminding
them of their cruelty in driving Prospero
from his dukedom, and leaving him and
his infant daughter to perish in the sea;
saying, that for this cause these terrors
were suffered to afflict them.

The King of Naples, and Antonio the
false brother, repented the injustice they
had done to Prospero.

“Then bring them here, Ariel,” said
Prospero.

Ariel soon returned with the king,
Antonio, and old Gonzalo. This Gonzalo
was the same who had so kindly provided
Prospero formerly with books and provisions, when his wicked brother left
him, as he thought, to perish in an open
boat in the sea.

Grief and terror had so stupefied
their senses, that they did not know
Prospero. He first discovered himself to
the good old Gonzalo, calling him the
preserver of his life; and then his brother
and the king knew that he was the injured
Prospero.

Antonio with tears, and sad words
of sorrow and true repentance, implored
his brother’s forgiveness and Prospero
forgave them; and, upon their engaging to
restore his dukedom, he said to the King of
Naples, “I have a gift in store for you too;”
and opening a door, showed him his son
Ferdinand playing chess with Miranda.

    Nothing could exceed the joy of
the father and the son at this unexpected
meeting, for they each thought the other
drowned in the storm.

The King of Naples was almost
as much astonished at the beauty and
excellent graces of the young Miranda, as
his son had been. “Who is this maid?” said
he; “She is the daughter to this Prospero,
who is the famous Duke of Milan, of whose
renown I have heard so much, but never
saw him till now: of him I have received
a new life: he has made himself to me a
second father, giving me this dear lady,”
said Ferdinand

“No more of that,” said Prospero: “let
us not remember our troubles past, since
they so happily have ended.” And then
Prospero embraced his brother, and again
assured him of his forgiveness.

Prospero now told them that their
ship was safe in the harbour, and the
sailors all on board her, and that he and
his daughter would accompany them
home the next morning.

Before Prospero left the island, he
dismissed Ariel from his service, to the
great joy of that lively little spirit.
