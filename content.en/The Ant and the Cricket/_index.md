    A silly young cricket, **accustomed to** sing\
Through the warm, sunny months of gay summer and spring,\
Began to complain when he found that, at home,\
His cupboard was empty, and winter was come.

Not a **crumb** to be found\
On the snow-covered ground;\
Not a flower could he see,\
Not a leaf on a tree.

“Oh! what will become,” says cricket, “of me?”\
At last by starvation and **famine** made bold,\
All dripping with wet, and all trembling with cold,\
Away he set off to a **miserly** ant,\
To see if, to keep him alive, he would grant\

Him shelter from rain.\
And a mouthful of grain.
He wished only to borrow;\
He’d repay it tomorrow;\

If not, he must die of starvation and sorrow.
Says the ant to the\
cricket, “I’m your servant\
and friend,\
But we ants never\
borrow; we ants never\
lend.

But tell me, dear cricket,\
Did you lay anything by\
When the weather was\
warm?” **quoth** the cricket,\
“Not I!”\

My heart was so light\
That I sang day and night,\
For all nature looked gay.”\
“For all nature looked **gay**”.
“ You sang, Sir, you say?\

Go then”, says the ant, “and dance the winter away”.
Thus ending, he **hastily** lifted the wicket,\
And out of the door turned the poor little cricket.
Folks call this a fable. I‘ll **warrant** it true:\
Some crickets have four legs, and some have two.
