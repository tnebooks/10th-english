##A Dilemma

I was just thirty-seven when my
Uncle Philip died. A week before that
event he sent for me; and here let me say
that I had never set eyes on him. He hated
my mother, but I do not know why. She
told me long before his last illness that I
need expect nothing from my father’s
brother. He was an inventor, an able and
ingenious mechanical engineer, and had
much money by his improvement in
turbine-wheels. He was a bachelor; lived
alone, cooked his own meals, and collected
precious stones, especially rubies and
pearls. From the time he made his first
money he had this **mania**. As he grew
richer, the desire to possess rare and costly
gems became stronger. When he bought a
new stone, he carried it in his pocket for a
month and now and then took it out and
looked at it. Then it was added to the
collection in his safe at the trust company.

At the time he sent for
me I was a clerk, and poor
enough. Remembering
my mother’s words, his
message gave me, his sole
relative, no new hopes;
but I thought it best to go. 

When I sat down by his bedside, he
began, with a malicious grin:

“I suppose you think me queer.
I will explain.” What he said was certainly
queer enough. “I have been living on an
annuity into which I put my fortune. In
other words, I have been, as to money,
concentric half of my life to enable me
to be as eccentric as I pleased the rest
of it. Now I repent of my wickedness to
you all, and desire to live in the memory
of at least one of my family. You think I
am poor and have only my annuity. You
will be profitably surprised. I have never
parted with my precious stones; they will
be yours. You are my sole heir. I shall carry
with me to the other world the satisfaction
of making one man happy. 

“No doubt you have always had
expectations, and I desire that you should
continue to expect. My jewels are in my
safe. There is nothing else left”.

When I thanked him he grinned all
over his lean face, and said:

“You will have to pay for my funeral.”

I must say that I never looked forward
to any expenditure with more pleasure
than to what it would cost me to put him
away in the earth. As I rose to go, he said:

“The rubies are valuable. They are in
my safe at the trust company. Before you
unlock the box, be very careful to read a
letter which lies on top of it; and be sure
not to shake the box.” I thought this odd.
“Don’t come back. It won’t hasten things.”

He died that day next week, and was
handsomely buried. The day after, his will
was found, leaving me his heir. I opened
his safe and found in it nothing but an
iron box, evidently of his own making, for
he was a skilled workman and very
ingenious. The box was heavy and strong,
about ten inches long, eight inches wide
and ten inches high. 

I stood **appalled**, the key in my hand. Was it true? Was it a lie? I had spent all my
savings on the funeral, and was poorer than ever.

Remembering the old man’s **oddity**, his malice, his cleverness in mechanic arts, and
the patent explosive which had helped to make him rich, I began to feel how very likely it
was that he had told the truth in this cruel letter. 

I carried the iron box away to my lodgings, set it down with care in a closet, laid the
key on it, and locked the **closet**. 

Then I sat down, as yet hopeful, and
began to exert my ingenuity upon ways
of opening the box without being killed.
There must be a way. 

After a week of vain thinking I
bethought me, one day, that it would be
easy to explode the box by unlocking it at
a safe distance, and I arranged a plan with
wires, which seemed as if it would answer.
But when I reflected on what would
happen when the dynamite scattered the
rubies, I knew that I should be none the
richer. For hours at a time I sat looking at
that box and handling the key. 

At last I hung the key on my watchguard; but then it occurred to me that it
might be lost or stolen. Dreading this, I
hid it, fearful that someone might use it to
open the box. This state of doubt and fear
lasted for weeks, until I became nervous
and began to dread that some accident
might happen to that box. A burglar might
come and boldly carry it away and force
it open and find it was a wicked fraud of
my uncle’s. Even the rumble and vibration
caused by the heavy vans in the street
became at last a terror.

Worst of all, my salary was reduced,
and I saw that marriage was out of the
question.

In my despair I consulted Professor
Clinch about my dilemma, and as to some
safe way of getting at the rubies. He said
that, if my uncle had not lied, there was
none that would not ruin the stones,
especially the pearls, but that it was a silly
tale and altogether incredible. I offered
him the biggest ruby if he wished to test
his opinion. He did not desire to do so.

Dr. Schaff, my uncle’s doctor,
believed the old man’s letter, and added a
caution, which was entirely useless, for by
this time I was afraid to be in the room
with that terrible box.

At last the doctor kindly warned me
that I was in danger of losing my mind
with too much thought about my rubies.
In fact, I did nothing else but **contrive**
wild plans to get at them safely. I spent all
my spare hours at one of the great libraries
reading about dynamite. 

Indeed, I talked of it until the library
attendants, believing me a lunatic or a
dynamite fiend, declined to humor me,
and spoke to the police. I suspect that for
a while I was “shadowed” as a suspicious,
and possibly criminal, character. I gave
up the libraries, and, becoming more and
more fearful, set my precious box on a
down pillow, for fear of its being shaken;
for at this time even the absurd possibility
of its being disturbed by an earthquake
troubled me. I tried to calculate the amount
of shake needed to explode my box.

The old doctor, when I saw him
again, begged me to give up all thought of
the matter, and, as I felt how completely I
was the slave of one **despotic** idea, I tried
to take the good advice thus given me. 

Unhappily, I found, soon after,
between the leaves of my uncle’s Bible,
a numbered list of the stones with their
cost and much beside. It was dated two
years before my uncle’s death. Many of
the stones were well known, and their
enormous value amazed me.

Several of the rubies were described
with care, and curious histories of them
were given in detail. One was said to be the
famous “Sunset ruby,” which had belonged
to the Empress-Queen Maria Theresa.
One was called the “Blood ruby,” not, as
was explained, because of the color, but on
account of the murders it had occasioned.
Now, as I read, it seemed again to threaten
death.

The pearls were described with care
as an unequalled collection. Concerning
two of them my uncle had written what I 
might call biographies—for, indeed, they
seemed to have done much evil and some
good. One, a black pearl, was mentioned
in an old bill of sale as—She—which
seemed **queer** to me.

It was maddening. Here, guarded
by a vision of sudden death, was wealth
“beyond the dreams of **avarice**.” I am not
a clever or ingenious man; I know little
beyond how to keep a ledger, and so I was,
and am, no doubt, absurd about many of
my notions as to how to solve this riddle. 

At one time I thought of finding a
man who would take the risk of unlocking
the box, but what right had I to subject
anyone else to the trial I dared not face?
I could easily drop the box from a height
somewhere, and if it did not explode could
then safely unlock it; but if it did blow up
when it fell, good-by to my rubies. Mine,
indeed! I was rich, and I was not. I grew
thin and morbid, and so miserable that,
I at last carried my troubles to my father 

confessor. He thought it simply a cruel
**jest** of my uncle’s, but was not so eager for
another world as to be willing to open my
box. 

He, too, counselled me to cease
thinking about it. Good heavens! I
dreamed about it. Not to think about it
was impossible. Neither my own thought
nor science nor religion had been able to
assist me.

Two years have gone by, and I am one
of the richest men in the city, and have no
more money than will keep me alive. 

Susan said I was half cracked
like Uncle Philip, and broke off her
engagement. In my despair I advertised
in the Journal of Science, and have had
absurd schemes sent me by the dozen.
At last, as I talked too much about it, the
thing became so well known that when
I put the horror in a safe, in a bank, I
was promptly desired to withdraw it. I
was in constant fear of burglars, and my
landlady gave me notice to leave, because
no one would stay in the house with that
box. I am now advised to print my story
and await advice from the ingenuity of the
American mind.

I have moved into the suburbs and
hidden the box and changed my name
and my occupation. This I did to escape
the curiosity of the reporters. I ought to
say that when the government officials
came to hear of my inheritance, they
were reasonably desired to collect the
succession tax on my uncle’s estate. 

I was delighted to assist them. I told
the collector my story, and showed him
Uncle Philip’s letter. Then I offered him
the key, and asked for time to get half a
mile away. That man said he would think
it over and come back later. 

This is all I have to say. I have made
a will and left my rubies and pearls to the
Society for the Preservation of Human
**vivisection**. If any man thinks this account
a joke or an invention, let him coldly
imagine the situation:

Given an iron box, known to contain
wealth, and to contain dynamite, arranged
to explode when the key is used to unlock
it – what would any sane man do? What
would he advise?

and received the degree of M.D. in
1850. He is considered the father
of neurology as well as a pioneer in
scientific medicine. He published
more than 25 literary titles and his
medical experiences and background
