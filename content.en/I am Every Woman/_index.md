##I am Every Woman*

This poem talks about the multifaceted nature of women. Today's women are
empowered, brave, strong and resolute. They are always ready to take up new ventures.
They are persistent and work tirelessly to prove what they are capable of. Women
have to be treated respectfully for the growth of a nation.

A woman is beauty **innate**,\
A symbol of power and strength.
She puts her life at **stake**,\
She's real, she's not fake!\

The summer of life she's ready to see in spring.
She says, "Spring will come again, my dear.
Let me care for the ones who're near.”
She's The Woman – she has no fear!\\

Strong is she in her faith and beliefs.
"**persistence** is the key to everything,"\
says she. Despite the **sigh**s and **groans** and **moans**,\
She's strong in her faith, firm in her belief!\

She's a lioness; don't **mess with** her.
She'll not spare you if you're a **prankster**.
Don't ever try to saw her pride, her self-respect.
She knows how to thaw you, saw you – so beware!\

She's today's woman. Today's woman, dear.
Love her, respect her, keep her near...
