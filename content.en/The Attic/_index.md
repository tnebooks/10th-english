It is natural for human beings to make mistakes. When we realise our mistakes, we
should try to rectify them. If you get a chance to rectify your mistake or pay back for
it......... what would you do and how would you correct it?

Aditya and I were returning from the
site of our new factory at Deodarganj. We
were driving along National Highway 40.
We had reached a point where the road
**bifurcated**. If we drove ten kilometres
along the road that branched off to the
right, we would reach Bramhapur. I asked
Aditya whether he was interested in
revisiting the place of his birth, which he
had left after he had passed the
matriculation examination from the local
school to continue his studies in Calcutta.

‘When I left our ancestral house, twentynine years ago, the house was almost two
hundred years old,’ recollected Aditya. ‘I
doubt if even the school building, which
may have undergone many changes,
will be recognisable any more. Trying to
revive old childhood memories may prove
disappointing!’

But he said he wished to visit the tea
shop of Nagen Uncle, if it still existed, and
have a cup of tea there.

So we took the turning to the right
and decided to drive to Bramhapur, of
which Aditya’s ancestors were once the
zamindars.

Aditya’s father had left the ancestral
home and moved to Kolkata, where he had
set up his own business. After his death,
Aditya was looking after it, and I was his
friend and business partner.

It was the month of Magha, that
is January – February by the English
calendar – the middle of winter. By my
watch, it was 3:30 in the afternoon. The
sun was ****soothing****. On either side of the
road were paddy fields, as far as the eye
could see. Harvest was over and there had
been a good crop that year.

After about ten minutes, we came to
the local school. Beyond the iron gates
were the playing field and the two-storeyed 
school building. We got down from the
car and stood in front of the gate.

I asked Aditya whether everything was
still the same. He replied that everything
had changed.

‘Our school used to be one-storeyed,
and a new building has come up, which
wasn’t there.’

‘Were you not a good student?’ I asked.

    ‘Yes, but my position was always
second,’ he replied. We decided to go and
have tea at Nagen uncle’s tea shop, which
stood next to a grocery shop and opposite
a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Soon,
we caught sight of ‘Nagen’s Tea Cabin’
written on a signboard over the shop.

The owner of the tea shop, now over
sixty, a little rustic in appearance, with his
white neatly-combed hair and clean look,
was the same as before. He was wearing a
dhoti and a blue striped shirt that could
be seen from under a green shawl.

Not recognising Aditya, he asked us
where we had come from.

Not recognising Aditya, he asked us
where we had come from.

A little surprised, Nagen uncle asked
why we were there.

‘To have tea at your shop, ’ said Aditya.
‘Certainly, besides tea, I have biscuits and
savouries.
‘Give us two nankhatai each.’.

We sat on two tin chairs. There was
only one other customer sitting at a corner
table, neither eating nor drinking tea, but
sitting with his head bent, as though he
were sleeping.

Addressing him as Mr Sanyal, Nagen
uncle reminded him to go home, as it was
already 4 p.m. Other customers would
soon be coming. Addressing us he said,
with a wink in his eye, ‘A little hard of
hearing. Cannot see well either. But has
no money to buy spectacles.’

From his reaction to this speech, I
began to wonder whether Mr Sanyal was
not a little crazy as well, because suddenly
he stood up, stretched himself and,
raising his lean right arm, and with eyes
dilated, began to recite a poem by Tagore
– Panraksha (‘Keeping of a Promise’).
Having recited the poem, he left the place,
making the gesture of Namaste with his
hands, to nobody in particular.

I noticed a sudden change in Aditya’s
expression and I asked him the reason for it.
Without answering me, he asked Nagen uncle
who the gentleman was and what he did.

Nagen uncle replied, ‘Sasanka Sanyal.
What can be done? He leads a cursed life
– gone crazy, I think, but has not forgotten
any incident of the past. Sold his lands to
get his only daughter married. He lost his
wife and only son last year. Since then he
is somewhat changed – not really normal.’
‘Where does he stay?’

‘He stays with a friend of his father’s –
Jogesh Kabiraj. Sasanka comes here, has
tea and biscuits and always remembers to
pay – having an acute sense of self-respect.
But how long things will remain like this,
I don’t know’.

Having paid our bill and **ascertained**
the location of Jogesh Kabiraj’s house, we
got into the car. Aditya was at the wheel.
He expressed the wish to visit his house.
‘So you do want to see your house after
all?’ I said.

‘It has become essential to do so,’ Aditya
replied. His nerves seemed **overwrought**

for some reason. We soon reached the
house, which was surrounded by high
walls. Even from the ruins, one could
easily imagine how grand it must have
been once upon a time.

We entered the building, climbed up the
stairs and reached the attic on the second
floor of the house.

‘This was my favourite room,’ said
Aditya. The attic has always been a
favourite with children. It is in the attic
that the child seems to be in a world of its
own.

A portion of a wall of the attic had
**crumbled** down, and through the ‘window’
that had been created, we could see the
sky, the fields, a part of the rice mill, the
**spire** of the old temple. In the whole house,
the attic had probably been the worst hit
by wind and weather. The floor was strewn
with twigs and straw and pigeon droppings.
Among other things, there was a broken
cricket bat, the remains of an armchair
and a wooden packing case.

Aditya got on top of the packing case
and pushed his hand inside the ventilator,
thus upsetting a sparrow’s nest, a part of
which fell to the ground. However, he
heaved a sigh of relief when he had got
what he had been looking for. When I  asked him what it was, he said, ‘You’ll get
to know very soon.’

We next went to a jeweller’s to find
out the weight of the article. The jeweller
remarked that it was an antique. Our next
stop was the house of Jogesh Kabiraj.
Though I was a little curious, I didn’t ask
Aditya anything.

We entered the house and went to
the room where Sasanka Sanyal stayed.
Sasanka uncle was busy reciting verses
from Tagore. When he had finished,
Aditya asked, ‘May we come in?’
He turned and faced us.

‘No one visits me,’ he said in an
**unperturbed** manner.

‘Would you mind if we come in?’

‘Come in.’

Except for a charpoy there was nothing
else to sit on, so we remained standing.

‘Do you remember Aditya Narayan
Chowdhury?’ Aditya asked him.

‘Of course,’ said the gentleman. ‘’The
spoilt child of **affluent** parents! Was a
fairly good student but could never beat
me. He was extremely jealous of me. And
he used to tell lies.’

‘I know,’ said Aditya. He then took out a
packet from his pocket and handing it
over to him, said, ‘This is for you, from
Aditya.’

‘What is it?’ he asked.

‘Money’.

‘Money? How much money?’

‘One hundred and fifty rupees. He has
said that he will be happy if you accept it.’

‘Shall I laugh or cry? Aditya has given
me money! Why this sudden generosity?’

‘Man does change with time. Perhaps
Aditya is not the same Aditya as before?’

‘A change? I got the prize. He could not
bear it. He took it from me to show his
father and never returned it to me. Said
that there was a hole in his pocket and it
had fallen through it.

‘This is the price of the medal. It is yours.’

Sasanka Sanyal was amazed. He stared
at Aditya and said, ‘The price of the medal?
That could not be more than five rupees.
It was a silver medal.’ 

‘Silver is now thirty times costlier than
before.’

‘Really? I had no news of that. But …’

Sasanka uncle looked at the fifteen
ten-rupee notes in his hand and then
looked at Aditya. There was a completely
new expression on his face. He said,
‘Aditya, this **smacks** too much of charity.
Doesn’t it?’

We remained silent. Peering intently at
Aditya, Sasanka Sanyal smiled and said, ‘I
had recognised you at Nagen uncle’s tea
shop by that mole on your right cheek. I
could see you had not recognised me. So
I recited the same poem that I had recited
on the prize-giving day, on purpose, so
that you may remember. Then, when you
came to visit me, I couldn’t help venting
my anger on you.’

‘You have done the right thing. Your
grievances are absolutely justified. But
I will be happy if you accept the money,’
said Aditya.

Sasanka Sanyal shook his head and
said, ‘No. Money will soon be spent. I
would have preferred to have the medal
if it were possible. I would have forgotten
that unpleasant incident of my childhood
if I could get the medal back.’

So, the medal that had been hidden in
the **attic** for twenty-nine long years was
eventually restored to its owner.

‘Sriman Sasanka Sanyal – Special Prize
for Recitation - 1948’ was still clearly
engraved on it. **(Translated from the
Bengali story Chilekotha)**
