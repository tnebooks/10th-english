This is the classic
story of Mulan based on
the legend of Hua Mulan.
A legend is a story from
long ago that is believed
to be true, or mostly true.

Many years ago, China was in the
middle of a great war. The Emperor said
that one man from each Chinese family
must leave his family to join the army.
Mulan, a teenage girl who lived in a
faraway village of China, heard the news
when she was outside, washing clothes.

Mulan ran into the house. Her father
was sitting in a chair, carving a piece of
wood. “Father!” she said. “Did you hear
what the Emperor says each family must
do?”

“Yes,” said her old father, “I heard
about it in town. Well, I may as well go
pack up.” He put down his **carving**, stood
up and walked very slowly to his room.

“Wait!” said Mulan, “Father, you
have not been well. If I may say so, why at
your age must you keep up with all those
young men?”

“What else can be done?” said her
father. “Your brother is a child. He cannot
go.”

“Of course that's true,” said Mulan.
“He is too little. But I have an idea.” She
poured her father a cup of tea and handed
it to him. “Father, have some tea. Please sit
for a minute. I will be right back.”

"Very well, dear," said the father.

Mulan went into her room. With her
sword, she cut off her long, black hair. She
put on her father’s **robe**. Going back to
her father, Mulan said, “Look at me. I am
your son now. I will go in your place. I
will do my part for China.”

“No, my daughter!” said the old man.
“You cannot do this!”

“Father, listen please," said Mulan.
“For years, you trained me in **kung fu**.
You showed me how to use a sword.”
Mulan swung the sword back and forth
with **might**.

“Only so that you could stay safe!”
said her father. “I never meant for you
to go to war. If they find out you are a
woman, you know as well as I do that you
will die!”

“No one will find out, Father,” said
Mulan. She picked up her sword.

"Mulan!" said the Father. He tried to
get up but had to hold on to his chair. 

The daughter kissed him goodbye. "I
love you, Father," she said. "Take care of
yourself. Tell my brother I said goodbye."
She climbed on a family horse. And off
she went to join the Emperor’s army.

In the army, Mulan proved to be
a brave soldier. In time, she was put in
charge of other soldiers. Her battles went
so well that she was put in charge of more
soldiers. Her battles kept on going well.
After a few years Mulan was given the top
job – she would be General of the entire
army. 

Not long after that, a very bad fever
swept through the army. Many soldiers
were sick. And Mulan, the General of the
army, became sick, too. 

When the doctor came out of Mulan's
tent, he knew the truth.

“The General is a woman?” yelled
the soldiers. “How can this be?” Some
called out, “She tricked us!” and “We will
not fight for a woman!” They said, “Punish
her! Make her pay! The cost is for her to
die!” But others called out, in voices just as 

loud, “With Mulan, we win every battle!”
They said, “Stay away from our General!”

Just then, a soldier ran up.
“Everyone!" he called. "A surprise attack
is coming!”

Mulan heard this from inside her
tent. She got dressed and went outside.
She was not yet strong, but stood tall. She
told the soldiers where they must go to
hide so they could attack when the enemy
came. But they must get there fast! The
soldiers, even those who did not like that
their General was a woman, could tell that
Mulan knew what she was talking about. 

It worked! The battle was won. It was
such a big victory that the enemy gave up,
at last. The war was over, and China was
saved! You can be sure that after that last
battle, no one cared anymore that Mulan
was a woman.

The Emperor was so glad that Mulan
had ended the long war, he set aside the
rule about being a woman. “Mulan, stay
with me in the palace,” he said. “Someone
as smart as you would be a fine royal
adviser.” 

Mulan **bowed** deeply. “You are too
kind, Sire,” she said. “But if you please,
what I wish most of all is to return home
to my family.”

“Then at least take these fine gifts,”
said the Emperor. "So everyone at your
home and village will know how much the
Emperor of China thinks of you.”

Mulan returned to her village with six
fine horses and six fine swords. Everyone
cheered that she was safe. The person
who had saved China was their very own
Mulan!
