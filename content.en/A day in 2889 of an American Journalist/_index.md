##A day in 2889 of an American Journalist

The year is 2889, the
date 25th July and the
place is the office block
of the Managing Editor
of the Earth Herald, the
world’s largest newspaper.
In this futuristic story written in 1889,
the writer describes how he visualizes the
world a thousand years later – a world
of technological advancements where
newspapers are not printed but ‘spoken’. 

**Read the following excerpt for a glimpse
of this future world.**

That morning Francis Bennett awoke
in rather a bad temper. This was eight days
since his wife had been in France and he
was feeling a little lonely. As soon as he
awoke, Francis Bennett switched on his
**phonotelephote** whose wires led to the
house he owned in the **Champs-Elysees**.

The telephone, completed by the
telephote, is another of our time’s
conquests! Though the transmission of
speech by the electric current was already
very old, it was only since yesterday that
vision could also be transmitted. A
valuable discovery, and Francis Bennett
was by no means the only one to bless its
inventor when, in spite of the enormous
distance between them, he saw his wife
appear in the telephotic mirror. ‘Francis
… dear Francis!...

His name, spoken by that sweet voice,
gave a happier turn to Francis Bennett’s
mood. He quickly jumped out of bed and
went into his mechanized dressing room.
Two minutes later, without needing the
help of a **valet**, the machine deposited 
him, washed, shaved, shod, dressed and
buttoned from top to toe, on the threshold
of his office. The day’s work was going to
begin.

Francis Bennett went on into the
reporters’ room. His fifteen hundred
reporters, placed before an equal number
of telephones, were passing on to
subscribers the news which had come in
during the night from the four quarters
of the earth. In addition to his telephone,
each reporter has in front of him a series
of commutators, which allow him to get
into communication with this or that
telephotic line.

Thus the subscribers have not only the
story but the sight of these events.

Francis Bennett questioned one of the
ten astronomical reporters – a service
which was growing because of the recent
discoveries in the stellar world.

‘Well, Cash, what have you got?’

‘**phototelegrams** from Mercury, Venus
and Mars, Sir.’

‘Interesting! And Jupiter?’

‘Nothing so far! We haven’t been able to
understand the signals the **jovians** make.
Perhaps ours haven’t reached them? ….’

‘Aren’t you getting some result from the
moon, at any rate?’

‘Not yet, Mr Bennett.’

‘Well, this time, you can’t blame
optical science! The moon is six hundred
times nearer than Mars, and yet our
correspondence service is in regular
operation with Mars. It can’t be telescopes
we need…’

‘No, it’s the **inhabitants**,’ Corley replied.

‘You dare tell me that the moon is
uninhabited?’

‘On the face it turns towards us, at any
rate, Mr Bennett. Who knows whether on
the other side…’

‘Well, there’s a very simple method of
finding out.’

‘And that is?’

‘To turn the moon round!’

And that very day, the scientists of the
Bennett factory started working out some
mechanical means of turning our satellite
right round.

On the whole, Francis Bennett had
reason to be satisfied. One of the Earth
Herald’s astronomers had just determined
the elements of the new planet Gandini.
It is at a distance of 12,841,348,284,623
metres and 7 decimetres that this planet
describes its orbit round the sun in 572
years, 194 days, 12 hours, 43 minutes, 9.8
seconds. Francis Bennett was delighted
with such precision.

‘Good!’ he exclaimed. ‘Hurry up and
tell the reportage service about it. You
know what a passion the public has for
these astronomical questions. I’m anxious
for the news to appear in today’s issue!’

The next room, a broad gallery about
a quarter of a mile long, was devoted to
publicity, and it well may be imagined
what the publicity for such a journal as
the Earth Herald had to be. It brought in
a daily average of three million dollars.
They are gigantic signs reflected on the
clouds, so large that they can be seen all
over a whole country. From that gallery
a thousand projectors were unceasingly
employed in sending to the clouds, on
which they were reproduced in colour,
these inordinate advertisements.

At that moment the clock struck twelve.
The director of the Earth Herald left the
hall and sat down in a rolling armchair. In 
a few minutes he had reached his dining
room half a mile away, at the far end of
the office.

The table was laid and he took his place
at it. Within reach of his hand was placed
a series of taps and before him was the
curved surface of a phonotelephote, on
which appeared the dining room of his
home in Paris. Mr and Mrs Bennett had
arranged to have lunch at the same time
– nothing could be more pleasant than to
be face to face in spite of the distance, to
see one another and talk by means of the
phonotelephotic apparatus.

Like everybody else in easy
circumstances nowadays, Francis Bennett,
having abandoned domestic cooking,
is one of the subscribers to the Society
for Supplying Food to the Home, which
distributes dishes of a thousand types
through a network of pneumatic tubes.
This system is expensive, no doubt, but
the cooking is better. So, not without
some regret, Francis Bennett was lunching
in solitude. He was finishing his coffee
when Mrs Bennett, having got back home,
appeared in the telephote screen.

When he had finished his lunch, he
went across to the window, where his
aero-car was waiting.

‘Where are we going, Sir?’ asked the
aero-coachman. ‘Let’s see. I’ve got time…’
Francis Bennett replied. ‘Take me to my
accumulator works at Niagara.

The aero-car shot across space at a
speed of about four hundred miles an
hour. Below him were spread out the
towns with their moving pavements which
carry the wayfarers along the streets, and
the countryside, covered, as though by an
immense spider’s web, by the network of
electric wires.

Within half an hour, Francis Bennett
had reached his works at Niagara, where,
after using the force of the cataracts to
produce energy, he sold or hired it out to
the consumers. Then he returned, by way
of Philadelphia, Boston and New York, to
**Centropolis**, where his aero-car put him
down about five o’clock.

The waiting-room of the Earth Herald 
was crowded. A careful lookout was being
kept for Francis Bennett to return for the
daily audience he gave to his petitioners.
Among their different proposals he had to
make a choice, reject the bad ones, look
into the doubtful ones, and welcome the
good ones.

He soon got rid of those who had only
useless or impracticable schemes. A few of
the others received a better welcome, and
foremost among them was a young man
whose broad brow indicated a high degree
of intelligence.

‘Sir’, he began, ‘though the number of
elements used to be estimated at seventyfive, it has now been reduced to three, as
no doubt you are aware?’

‘Perfectly,’ Francis Bennett replied.

‘Well, Sir, I’m on the point of reducing
the three to one. If I don’t run out of money
I’ll have succeeded in three weeks.

‘And then?’

‘Then, Sir, I shall really have discovered
the absolute’.

‘And the results of that discovery?’

‘It will be to make the creation of all
forms of matter easy – stone, wood, metal,
fibrin ….

‘Are you saying you’re going to be able
to construct a human being?’

‘Complete… The only thing missing
will be the soul!’

Francis Bennett assigned the young
fellow to the scientific editorial department
of his journal.

A second inventor, using as a basis some
old experiments that dated from the 19th
century, had the idea of moving a whole
city in a single block. He suggested, as a
demonstration, the town of Saaf, situated
fifteen miles from the sea; after conveying
it on rails down to the shore, he would
transform it into a seaside resort. Francis
Bennett, attracted by this project, agreed
to take a half-share in it.

The proposals heard and dealt with,
Francis Bennett went to stretch himself
out in an easy-chair in the audition-room.
Then, pressing a button, he was put into
communication with the Central Concert.
After so busy a day, what charm he found
in the works of our greatest masters,
based on a series of delicious harmonicoalgebraic formulae! During his meal,
phonotelephotic communication had
been set up with Paris.

‘When do you expect to get back to
Centropolis, dear Edith?’ asked Francis
Bennett.

‘I’m going to start this moment’.

‘By tube or aero-train?’

‘By tube’.

‘Then you’ll be here?’

‘At eleven fifty-nine this evening’.

‘Paris time?’

‘No, no! … Centropolis time’.

‘Goodbye then, and above all don’t miss
the tube!’

These submarine tubes, by which one
travels from Paris in two hundred and ninety-five minutes, are certainly much
preferable to the aero-trains, which only
manage six hundred miles an hour.

Francis Bennett, very tired after so
very full a day, decided to take a bath
before going to bed. There was always
a bath already in the office. He touched
the button. A rumbling sound began, got
louder, increased … Then one of the doors
opened and the bath appeared, gliding
along on its rails …

##About the author
**Jules Verne**
(1828–1905) was
a French poet,
playwright and
novelist but he
earns his place on
this list of great
writers because
of his futuristic
adventure novels. He has been called
the father of science fiction and has
had an incalculable influence on the
development of science fiction writing.
More interesting, perhaps, is his place
as a prophet or predictor of technology
which wasn’t to be invented until long
after his death. He put a man on the
moon, including its launch from a
Florida launchpad to its splashdown
in the Pacific; in 1863 he predicted
the internet: Paris in the 20th Century
(1863) depicts the details of modern life:
skyscrapers, television, Maglev trains,
computers, and a culture preoccupied
with the Internet.
