##No Men Are Foreign*

Remember, no men are strange, no countries foreign\
Beneath all uniforms, a single body breathes\
Like ours: the land our brothers walk upon\
Is earth like this, in which we all shall lie.
They, too, aware of sun and air and water,\
Are fed by peaceful harvests, by war’s long winter starv’d.
Their hands are ours, and in their lines we read\
A **labour** not different from our own.
Remember they have eyes like ours that wake\
Or sleep, and strength that can be won\
By love. In every land is common life\
That all can recognise and understand.
Let us remember, whenever we are told\
To hate our brothers, it is ourselves\
That we shall dispossess, **betray**, **condemn**.
Remember, we who take arms against each other\
It is the human earth that we **defile**.
Our hells of fire and dust **outrage** the innocence\
Of air that is everywhere our own,\
Remember, no men are foreign, and no countries strange.
