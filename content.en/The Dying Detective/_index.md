##The Dying Detective

Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of
Sherlock Holmes, came to me and said,
“Mr. Holmes is dying, Mr. Watson. For
three days he has been sinking, and I doubt
if he will last another day. He would not
let me get a doctor. I told him I could not
stand it anymore and would get a doctor.”
He replied, “Let it be Watson then.”

I was horrified for I had not heard
about his illness before. I rushed for my
hat and coat. As we drove back, I asked
her about the details.

“There is little I can tell you, sir.
He has been working on a case down
at Rotherhithe, near the river, and has
brought this illness back with him. He
took to bed on Wednesday afternoon and
has never moved since. For three days
neither food nor drink has passed his lips.”
“Why did you not call a doctor?” I asked.

“He wouldn’t have it, sir. I didn’t dare
to disobey him.”

He was indeed a sad sight. In the
dim light of a foggy November day, the
sick-room was a gloomy spot, but it was 
the gaunt face staring from the bed that
brought chill to my heart. His eyes had
the brightness of fever, his cheeks were
flushed, and his hand **twitched** all the
time. He lay listless.

“My dear fellow!” I cried approaching him.

“Stand back! Stand right back!” he cried.

“But why? I want to help you,” I said.

“Certainly, Watson, but it is for your own
sake.”

“For my sake?” I was surprised.

“I know what is the matter with me.
It is the disease from Sumatra. It is deadly
and **contagious**, Watson – that’s it, by
touch.”

“Good heavens, Holmes! Do you
think this can stop me?” I said advancing
towards him.

“If you will stand there, I will talk. If
you don’t you must leave the room,” said
my master.

I have always given in to Holmes’
wishes. But now my feelings as a doctor
were aroused. I was at least his master in
the sick-room.

“Holmes,” I said, “you are not yourself
whether you like it or not. I will examine
your symptoms and treat you.”

“If I am to have a doctor,” said he,
“let me at least have someone in whom I
have confidence.”

“Then you have none in me?”

“In your friendship, certainly. But
facts are facts, Watson. You are a general
practitioner, not a specialist of this
disease.

“If so, let me bring Sir Japer Meek or
Penrose Fisher, or any other best man in
London.”

“How ignorant you are! Watson!” he
said with a groan.

“What do you know about Tarpaunli
fever or the black Formosa **plague**?”

“I have never heard of them,”
I admitted.

“There are many problems of the
disease in the East. I have learnt that much
during my recent researches. And during
this course I caught this illness,” he said.

“I will bring Dr. Ainstree then,”
I said going towards the door. Never have
I had such a shock when the dying man
**bolted** the door and locked it, shouted in
an uncontrolled way and in a moment he
was back in his bed.

“You won’t have the key by force
from me Watson. Be here till 6 o’clock. It
is four now”

“This is madness, Holmes,” I said.

“Only two hours, Watson. Then you
can get a doctor of my choice. You can 
read some books, over there. At six we will
talk again.”

Unable to settle down to reading, I
walked slowly round and round, looking
at the pictures. Finally I came to the
**mantle piece**, where among other things I
saw a small black and white ivory box with
sliding lid. As I held it in my hand to
examine it, I heard a dreadful cry. “Put it
down! Down at once, Watson,” he said,
“I hate to have my things touched. Sit
down man, and let me have my rest!”

Then I sat in silent dejection until
the stipulated time had passed. 

 “Now Watson,” he said, “Have you
any change?”

“Yes,” I replied.

“How many half- crowns? Put them
in your watch – pocket. And all the rest in
your trouser pocket. You will light the gas
lamp, but it must be half on. You will have
the kindness to place some letters and 
paper on the table within my reach. Now
place the ivory box on the table within my
reach. Slide the lid a bit with **tongs**. Put
the tongs on the table. Good! Now you
can go and fetch Mr. Culverton Smith, of
13 Lower Burke Street’’

I was hesitant to leave him now. He was
delirious.

“I have never heard of the name,’’ I said.

“Well, he is the man who has the
knowledge of this disease but he is not a
medical man. He is a planter. He lives in
Sumatra, now visiting London. I didn’t
want you to go before six, because you
wouldn’t have found him in his study.
I hope you will be able to persuade him to
come. You will tell him exactly how you
have left me.” He said, “You must tell him
that I’m dying – plead with him, Watson.”

“I’ll bring him in a cab,’’ I said.

“No. You will persuade him to come
and return before him. Make any excuse.
Remember this, Watson.”

I saw Mrs. Hudson was waiting
outside, trembling and crying. Below, as I
waited for the cab, I met Inspector Morton
of the Scotland Yard. He was not in his
uniform.

“How is he?” asked Inspector Morton.
“He is very ill,” I answered.

I reached Mr. Culverton Smith’s
house. The butler appeared at the doorway.
Through the half-open door I heard a
man’s voice telling the butler, “I am not at
home, say so.” I pushed past the butler and
entered the room. I saw a **frail** man with
bald head sitting. “I am sorry,” I said, “but
the matter cannot be delayed. Mr. Sherlock
Holmes………….”

The mere mention of his name had a
different effect on the man.

“Have you come from Holmes? How
is he?” he asked.

“He is very ill. That is why I have
come. Mr. Holmes has a high opinion of
you and thought you are the only man in
London who can help him.”

The little man was **startled**.

“Why?” he asked.

“Because of your knowledge of the
Eastern diseases,” I replied.

“How did he get it?” he asked.

I told him everything. He smiled
and agreed to come. Pretending that I had
some other appointment. I left him. With
a sinking heart I reached Holmes’ room.
I told him that Mr. Smith was coming.

“Well done! Watson!” he said. “You
have done everything that a good friend
could do. Now you disappear to the next
room. And don’t speak, or come here.”

I heard the footsteps. I heard a voice
say, “Holmes! Holmes! Can you hear me?”

“Is that you Mr. Smith?” Holmes
whispered. “You know what is wrong with
me. You are the only one in London who
can cure me.”

“Do you know the symptoms?” asked
Smith.

“Only too well, Mr. Smith,” and he
described the symptoms.

“They are the same, Holmes,” Smith
said, “Poor Victor was a dead man on the
fourth day -a strong and healthy young
man. What a coincidence indeed!”

“I know that you did it,” said Holmes.

“Well, you can’t prove it.”

“Give me water, please,” Holmes
**groan**ed.

“Here.” I heard Smith’s voice.

“Cure me, please. Well, about Victor

Savage’s death. You did it. I’ll forget
everything, but cure me. I’ll forget about it.”

“You can forget or remember, just as
you like. It doesn’t matter to me how my
nephew died. Watson said you got it from
the Chinese sailors. Could there be any
other reason?” 

“I can’t think. My mind is gone, help
me,” pleaded Holmes.

“Did anything come by post? A box
by chance? On Wednesday?”

“Yes I opened it and there was a sharp spring inside it. A joke perhaps. It
drew blood,” said Holmes.

“No, it was not a joke, you fool,
you’ve got it. Who asked you to cross my
path? You knew too much about Victor’s
death. Your end is near, Holmes. I’ll carry
this box in my pocket. The last piece of
evidence!”

“Turn up the gas, Smith,” said Holmes
in his natural voice.

“Yes I will, so that I can see you
better.” There was silence. Then I heard
Smith say, “What’s all this?”

“Successful acting,” said Holmes,
“for three days I didn’t taste anything –
neither food nor drink.”

There were footsteps outside. The
door opened and I heard Inspector
Morton’s voice. “I arrest you on charge of
murder,” he said.

“If so, let me bring Sir Jaspet Meek or
Penrose fisher, or Holmes”.

There was a sudden rush and **scuffle**,
followed by the clash of iron and sudden
cry of pain. There was a click of handcuffs.
Holmes asked me to come in.

“Sorry, Watson, I was rude to you.
I undermined your capability as a doctor.
It was just to get Smith here. And I didn’t
want you to know that I was not ill.”

“But your appearance--?” I said.

“Three days, fasting and the makeup did the trick.”

“The coins?”

“Oh! That was only to prove that I
was **delirious**,” he laughed. “I need to eat
now, Watson. Mr. Smith killed his nephew
and he wanted to kill me the same way to
avoid imprisonment. I need to eat now,
Watson. I think that something nutritious
at Simpsons’ would not be out of place.
And thank you, Watson,” he said.
