Holland is a country where much of
the land lies below sea level. Only great
walls called dikes keep the North Sea
from rushing in and flooding the land.
For centuries the people of Holland have
worked to keep the walls strong so that
their country will be safe and dry. Even
the little children know the dikes must be
watched every moment, and that a hole
no longer than your finger can be a very
dangerous thing. 

Many years ago there lived in
Holland a boy named Peter. Peter’s father
was one of the men who tended the gates
in the dikes, called sluices. He opened and
closed the **sluices** so that ships could pass
out of Holland’s canals into the great sea. 

One afternoon in the early fall, when
Peter was eight years old, his mother called
him from his play. “Come, Peter,” she said.
“I want you to go across the dike and take
these cakes to your friend, the blind man.
If you go quickly, and do not stop  to play,
you will be home again before dark.”

The little boy was glad to go on such
an errand, and started off with a light
heart. He stayed with the poor blind man
a little while to tell him about his walk
along the dike and about the sun and the
flowers and the ships far out at sea. Then he remembered his mother’s wish that he
should return before dark and, bidding
his friend goodbye, he set out for home.

As he walked beside the canal, he
noticed how the rains had swollen the
waters, and how they beat against the side
of the dike, and he thought of his father’s
gates.

“I am glad they are so strong,” he said
to himself. “If they gave way what would
become of us? These pretty fields would
be covered with water. Father always calls
them the `angry waters.´ I suppose he
thinks they are angry at him for keeping
them out so long.”

As he walked along he sometimes
stopped to pick the pretty blue flowers
that grew beside the road, or to listen
to the rabbits´soft tread as they rustled
through the grass. But oftener he smiled 
as he thought of his visit to the poor blind
man who had so few pleasures and was
always so glad to see him.

Suddenly he noticed that the sun
was setting, and that it was growing
dark. “Mother will be watching for me,”
he thought, and he began to run toward
home.

Just then he heard a noise. It was the
sound of **trickling** water! He stopped and
looked down. There was a small hole in
the dike, through which a tiny stream was
flowing,

Any child in Holland is frightened at
the thought of a leak in the dike.

Peter understood the danger at
once. If the water ran through a little
hole it would soon make a larger one,
and the whole country would be flooded.
In a moment he saw what he must do.
Throwing away his flowers, he climbed
down the side of the dike and thrust his
finger into the tiny hole.

The flowing of the water was stopped!

“Oho!” he said to himself. “The
angry waters must stay back now. I can
keep them back with my finger. Holland
shall not be drowned while I am here.”

This was all very well at first, but
soon it grew dark and cold. The little fellow
shouted and screamed. “Come here; come
here,” he called. But no one heard him; no
one came to help him.

It grew still colder, and his arm
ached, and began to grow stiff and **numb**. 

He shouted again. “Will no one come?
Mother! Mother!”

But his mother had looked anxiously
along the dike road many times since
sunset for her little boy, and now she
had closed and locked the cottage door,
thinking that Peter was spending the night
with his blind friend, and that she would
scold him in the morning for staying away
from home without permission. Peter
tried to whistle, but his teeth **chattered**
with the cold. He thought of his brother
and sister in their warm beds, and of his
dear father and mother. “I must not let
them be drowned,” he thought. “I must
stay here until someone comes, if I have to
stay all night.”

The moon and stars looked down on
the child **crouching** on a stone on the side
of the dike. His head was bent, and his
eyes were closed, but he was not asleep, for
every now and then he rubbed the hand
that was holding back the angry sea.

“I’ll stand it somehow,” he thought.
So he stayed there all night keeping the
sea out.

Early the next morning a man going
to work thought he heard a groan as he
walked along the top of the **dike**. Looking
over the edge, he saw a child clinging to
the side of the great wall.

“What’s the matter?” he called. “Are
you hurt?”

“I’m keeping the water back!” Peter
yelled. “Tell them to come quickly!”

The alarm was spread. People came
running with shovels and the hole was
soon mended.

They carried Peter home to his
parents, and before long the whole town
knew how he had saved their lives that
night. To this day, they have never
forgotten the brave little hero of Holland.
