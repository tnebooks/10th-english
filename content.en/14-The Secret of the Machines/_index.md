##The Secret of the Machines

We were taken from the ore-bed and the mine,
We were melted in the **furnace** and the pit
We were cast and **wrought** and hammered to design,
We were cut and filed and tooled and **gauge**d to fit.

Some water, coal, and oil is all we ask,
And a **thousandth** of an inch to give us play:
And now, if you will set us to our task,
We will serve you four and twenty hours a day!

We can pull and **haul** and push and lift and drive,
We can print and plough and weave and heat and light,
We can run and race and swim and fly and dive,
We can see and hear and count and read and write!

But remember, please, the Law by which we live,
We are not built to **comprehend** a lie,
We can neither love nor pity nor forgive,
 If you make a slip in handling us you die!

Though our smoke may hide the Heavens from your eyes,
It will vanish and the stars will shine again,
Because, for all our power and weight and size,
We are nothing more than children of your brain!
