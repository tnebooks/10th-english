##Tech Bloomers

Have you ever thought that your
refrigerator can order stuff on its own?
Well, anything which is below a predefined limit or below certain threshold,
can be self-ordered by the appliance.
Your refrigerator can directly link to the
ecommerce site and order for milk if it
is about to be exhausted. Consumable
products such as ink cartridges may be
capable of self-ordering replacements
when the current level falls below a certain
threshold. 

Have you ever wished you were
better informed? Managing entertainment
and home appliances by voice commands
or by swapping the finger is a reality now.
Getting bored by the program you watch
on TV? Just tell your smart TV that you
want to view your social feed instead. If
you are struck in a traffic jam, just let
your kettle make some tea for you which
you can sip, piping hot, the moment
you reach home. Your entire water and
energy management can be taken care by
automating all the activities. 

Technology has not only made a
normal person’s life easier but it is also a
boon to citizens with special needs. India
is home to 2.7 crore people living with one
or the other kind of disability. According 
to the 2011 Census, 2.21 percent of India’s
population is disabled. Unlike the
developed world, India’s disabled are
deprived by attitudinal barriers as they
continue to **grapple** with the challenges of
access, acceptance and **inclusion**.

Alisha says, “I would probably still
have done it because I want everyone to
know the difference technology has made
in my life. But it would have been
frustrating and difficult.”

“I have cerebral palsy and I can’t
physically type as fast as I think or
anywhere near. But right now, that’s what
I’m doing. I bet you’re wondering how!

I am using a piece of technology
called Dragon Dictate. I speak, and the
words appear on my screen and then I can 
print them out. It’s made a huge difference
to me. It’s made me achieve things I only
dreamt of.

I used to have a teacher, she’s
passed away now and one day she said
to me. ‘You’re going to do your Maths
GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary
Education).’ I said, ‘No I’m not. Don’t be
silly.’ I didn’t think I could do anything like
that. Studying was so difficult because I
had to rely on someone to type everything
into a computer for me.

But that’s changed now. I can do it
myself with my voice. 

Kim, who is the **assistive technologist**
at my school, introduced me to Dragon
Dictate and it has opened up the world to
me.

Kim showed me how to train it to
understand my voice, it took a few hours.
Now I use it in class and at home as well. It
has made me more independent and I am
now able to study on my own. So now I’m
doing my Maths GCSE. I know my teacher
will be proud of me.

I never thought I’d be able to do one
GCSE in my life, but I’m going to do two.
And I feel like I want to push myself even
further. Kim says technology can help
me do that, it is opening up the world for
young disabled people like me.

There are many different types of
technology that can help a young disabled
person become independent. For example,
if someone has very limited movement
they can control a computer screen with
Eye Gaze. That means when they’re
reading they can move from page to page
using the pupils of their eyes. They don’t
need to press a button or anything.

Just one person, Kim, works with
all 42 students here at my school and
helps us use technology in different ways.
She’s amazing. I don’t know what we’d
do without her we’d lose out on so many
opportunities.

It has opened up the world to me.

21 - year - old David says, “Technology
is very important because it enables me to
communicate and be independent, which
gives me freedom.”

For verbal communication, David
uses a **Liberator Communication Device**,
which he controls with his eye movements.
It has a Bluetooth adaptor, so it lets him
use any PC or Mac by sending commands
through the Liberator.

“It was a great feeling when I learnt
to use it, it took me a couple of weeks.
Communicating with people was very
difficult before.”

He has an ACTIV controller also in
the headrest of his chair in his bedroom,
which means he can control his TV, BluRay and music players.

David was born with Athetoid
**cerebral palsy** and attends a specialist
school and college. He has been using a
high tech communication aid since he was
eight years old and has been interested
in AAC(Augmentative and Alternative
Communication) and technology ever
since! 

When David first started out with
AAC, he used a head switch to access
his AAC device running a page - based
system, which took lots of navigation and
required a lot of effort combined with
switching.

He now uses an ECO2 with ECO point,
making his selections with a foot switch
once he has fixed his gaze on the icon that is
required. He has a smaller communication
aid. It has been mounted on his walker. It
is essential that much of his spare time is
spent in the performing arts! David is also a
keen sportsman, regularly playing football,
boccia, hockey and baseball. He is a sports
leader and uses his ECO2 linked to an
interactive white board to teach PE lessons. 

David has 144 icons on the screen
that he uses with ECO point Eye Gaze.
When David first tried this access method,
his response was “I like it, it makes me
faster, when can I have one?” Now David
uses his ECO2 and ECO point to access
the curriculum, study for his GCSE, order
food and communicate while he is in
restaurants and argue with his brother.
You name it, David can communicate it! 

David will now use his ECO2 to speak
in complete sentences with correct syntax.
It has increased the number of words he
uses meaningfully and comment socially
using the language of his peers, thereby
becoming a confident and competent
communicator. David has recently been
working on idioms with his SLT, his latest
being "Mum has got a lot on her plate!"
David is also an advocate to other students
who use AAC and shows them how easy it 
is to communicate using the AC method. 

He controls his PlayStation with
a bespoke switch system, drives his
electric wheelchair with head switches
and uses the ECOpoint Eye Gaze system
to communicate, access the computer to
check on how the Chelsea football team is doing and send and receive text messages.
When he is at home he also plays MP3 on
his ECO2 from morning till night. 

David has recently been selected to
travel to Brazil to work with the Olympic
opening ceremony team as part of the
Remix Drama Group.

I guess technology makes your life
easier. Maybe it means you can keep in touch
with your family, you can talk to and even
see relatives who live far away. Well, Kim
has shown me that technology can do even
more for young disabled people like me. It
can help us make friends, communicate
and control our environment (like turning
the lights on and out). It can help us study,
get qualifications and find opportunities 
for work. It can make us confident and
independent.

World renowned physicist Stephen
Hawking is probably
the best example of
how Assistive
Technology has
helped a talented
mind overcome 
physical impairments and contribute
productively to the world. So we can now
look forward to a more inclusive way of
learning, instead of the **cloister**ed existence
that most differently- abled learners had
to face in the past. Newer technology
allows differently- abled learners to learn
with their peers as well as contribute
fruitfully to the **collaborative process** of
learning. This is indeed the new era of
learning – truly learning for all.
