##The Night the Ghost Got In
**Imagination of odd things always
leads to absolute humour. Read the lesson
and enjoy the narrator's experience with
his grandfather who creates chaos and
laughter with his imaginative stories.**

The ghost that got into our house on
the night of November 17, 1915, raised
such a hullabaloo of misunderstandings
that I am sorry I didn’t just let it keep on
walking, and go to bed. Its advent caused
my mother to throw a shoe through
a window of the house next door and
ended up with my grandfather shooting a
patrolman. I am sorry, therefore, as I have
said, that I ever paid any attention to the
footsteps.

They began about a quarter past one
o’clock in the morning, a rhythmic, quickcadenced walking around the diningroom table. My mother was asleep in
one room upstairs, my brother-Herman
in another, grandfather was in the attic,
in the old walnut bed which, as you will
remember, once fell on my father. I had just
stepped out of the bathtub and was busily
rubbing myself with a towel when I heard
the steps. They were the steps of a man
walking rapidly around the dining-table
downstairs. The light from the bathroom
shone down the back-steps, which
dropped directly into the dining-room; I
could see the faint shine of plates on the
plate-rail; I couldn’t see the table. The
steps kept going round and round the
table; at regular intervals a board creaked, 

when it was trod upon. I supposed at first
that it was my father or my brother Roy,
who had gone to Indianapolis but were
expected home at any time. I suspected
next that it was a burglar. It did not enter
my mind until later that it was a ghost.

After the walking had gone on
for perhaps three minutes, I tiptoed to
Herman’s room. ‘Psst!’ I hissed, in the
dark, shaking him. ‘Awp’, he said, in the
low, hopeless tone of a despondent beagle
– he always half suspected that something
would ‘get him’ in the night. I told him
who I was. ‘There’s something downstairs!’
I said. He got up and followed me to the
head of the back staircase. The steps had
ceased. Herman looked at me in some
alarm: I had only the bath towel around
my waist. He wanted to go back to bed, I
gripped his arm.

‘There’s something down there!’
I said. Instantly the steps began again,
circled the dining-room table like a man
running, and started up the stairs towards
us, heavily, two at a time. The light still
shone palely down the stairs; we saw
nothing coming; we only heard the steps.
Herman rushed to his room and slammed
the door. I slammed shut the door at the
stairs top and held my knee against it. After a long minute, I slowly opened it again. There was nothing there. There was no sound. None of us ever heard the ghost again.

The slamming of the doors had
aroused mother: she peered out of her
room. ‘What on earth are you boys doing?’
she demanded. Herman ventured out of
his room. ‘Nothing,’ he said, gruffly, but
he was, in colour, a light green. ‘What was
all that running around downstairs?’ said
mother. So she had heard the steps, too!
We just looked at her. ‘Burglars!’ she
shouted, intuitively. I tried to quieten her
by starting lightly downstairs.

‘Come on, Herman,’ I said.

I’ll stay with mother,’ he said. ‘She’s
all excited.’ 

I stepped back onto the landing

‘Don’t either of you go a step,’ said
mother. ‘We’ll call the police.’ Since the
phone was downstairs, I didn’t see how we
were going to call the police -- nor did I
want the police – but mother made one of
her quick, incomparable decisions. She
flung up a window of her bedroom which
faced the bedroom windows of the house
of a neighbour, picked up a shoe, and
whammed it through a pane of glass across 
the narrow space that separated the two
houses. Glass tinkled into the bedroom
occupied by a retired engraver named
Bodwell and his wife. Bodwell had been
for some years in rather a bad way and
was subject to mild ‘attacks’. Almost
everybody we knew or lived near had
some kind of attacks.

It was now about two o’clock of a
moonless night; clouds hung black and
low. Bodwell was at the window in a
minute, shouting frothing a little, shaking
his fist. ‘We’ll sell the house and go back
to Peoria,’ we could hear Mrs. Bodwell
saying. It was some time before mother
‘got through’ to Bodwell. ‘Burglars!’ she
shouted. ‘Burglars in the house!’ Herman
and I hadn’t dared to tell her that it was not
burglars but ghosts, for she was even more
afraid of ghosts than of burglars. Bodwell
at first thought that she meant there were
burglars in his house, but finally he quieted
down and called the police for us over an
extension phone by his bed. After he had
disappeared from the window, mother
suddenly made as if to throw another
shoe, not because there was further need
of it but, as she later explained, because
the thrill of heaving a shoe through a
window glass had enormously taken her
fancy. I prevented her.

The police were on hand in a
commendably short time: a Ford sedan
full of them, two on motorcycles, and a
patrol wagon with about eight in it and a
few reporters. They began banging at our 
front door. Flashlights shot streaks of
gleam up and down the walls, across the
yard, down the walk between our house
and Bodwell’s. ‘Open up!’ cried a hoarse
voice. ‘We’re men from Headquarters!’ I
wanted to go down and let them in, since
there they were, but mother wouldn’t hear
of it. ‘You haven’t a stitch on,’ she pointed
out. ‘You’d catch your death.’ I wound the
towel around me again. Finally the cops
put their shoulders to our big heavy front
door with its thick bevelled glass and
broke it in: I could hear a rending of wood
and a splash of glass on the floor of the
hall. Their lights played all over the livingroom and crisscrossed nervously in the
dining-room, stabbed into hallways, shot
up the front stairs and finally up the back.
They caught me standing in my towel at
the top. A heavy policeman bounded up
the steps. ‘Who are you?’ he demanded. ‘I
live here,’ I said.

The officer in charge reported to
mother. ‘No sign of nobody, lady,’ he said.
‘Musta got away – whatt’d he like?’ ‘There
were two or three of them,’ mother said,
‘whooping and carrying on slamming
doors.’ ‘Funny,’ said the cop. ‘All ya
windows and door was locked on the
inside tight as a tick.’

Downstairs,
we could hear the
tromping of the other
police. Police were all
over the place; doors
were yanked open, drawers were yanked

open, windows were shot up and pulled
down, furniture fell with dull thumps. A
half-dozen policemen emerged out of the
darkness of the front hallway upstairs.
They began to ransack the floor; pulled
beds away from walls, tore clothes off
hooks in the closets, pulled suitcase and
boxes off shelves. One of them found an
old zither that Roy had won in a pool
tournament. ‘Looky here, Joe,’ he said,
strumming it with a big paw. The cop
named Joe took it and turned it over.
‘What is it?’ he asked me. ‘It’s an old zither
our guinea pig used to sleep on,’ I said. It
was true that a pet guinea pig we once had
would never sleep anywhere except on the
zither, but I should never have said so.
Joe and the other cop looked at me a long
time. They put the zither back on a shelf. 

No sign o’ nothing’, said the cop
who had first spoken to mother, ‘The
lady seems hysterical.’ They all nodded,
but said nothing; just looked at me. In
the small silence we all heard a creaking
in the attic. Grandfather was turning
over in bed. ‘What’s that?’ snapped Joe.
Five or six cops sprang for the attic door
before I could intervene or explain.
I realized that it would be bad if they
burst in on grandfather unannounced, or
even announced. He was going through a
phase in which he believed that General
Meade’s men, under steady hammering
by Stonewall Jackson, were beginning to
retreat and even desert.

When I got to the attic, things were
pretty confused. Grandfather had
evidently jumped to the conclusion that
the police were deserters from Meade’s
army, trying to hide away in his attic. He
bounded out of bed wearing a long flannel 

nightgown over long woolen pants, a
nightcap, and a leather jacket around his
chest. The cops must have realized at once
that the indignant white-haired old man
belonged to the house, but they had no
chance to say so. ‘Back, ye cowardly dog!’
roared grandfather. ‘Back t’ the lines ye
goodaam Lily-livered cattle!’ With that,
he fetched the officer who found the zither
a flat – handed smack alongside his head
that sent him sprawling. The others beat a
retreat, but not enough; grandfather
grabbed zither’s gun from its holster and
let fly. The report seemed to crack the
rafters; smoke filled the attic. A cop cursed
and shot his hand to his shoulder.
Somehow, we all finally got downstairs
again and locked the door against the old
gentleman. He fired once or twice more in
the darkness and then went back to bed.
‘That was grandfather’, I explained to Joe,
out of breath. ‘He thinks you’re deserter.’
‘I’ll say he does,’ said Joe.

The cops were reluctant to leave
without getting their hand on somebody
besides grandfather; the night had been
distinctly a defeat for them. Furthermore,
they obviously didn’t like the ‘layout’;
something looked – and I can see their
viewpoint – phony. They began to poke
into things again. A reporter, a thin-faced,
wispy man, came up to me. I had put on
one of mother’s dress, not being able to
find anything else. The reporter looked at
me with mingled suspicion and interest.
‘Just what the hell is the real lowdown
here, Bud?’ he asked. I decided to be frankwith him. ‘We had ghosts,’ I said. He gazed
at me a long time as if I were a slot
machine into which he had, without
results, dropped a coin. Then he walked
away. The cops followed him, the one
grandfather shot holding his nowbandaged arm, cursing and blaspheming.
‘I’m gonna get my gun back from that old
bird,’ said the zither-cop. ‘Yeh,’ said Joe,
‘You – and who else?’ I told them I would
bring it to the station house the next day.

‘What was the matter with that one
policeman?’ mother asked, after they had
gone. ‘Grandfather shot him,’ I said. ‘What
for?’ she demanded. I told her he was a
deserter. ‘Of all things!’ said mother. ‘He
was such a nice-looking young man’.

Grandfather was fresh as a daisy and
full of jokes at breakfast next morning.
We thought at first he had forgotten all
about what had happened, but he hadn’t.
Over his third cup of coffee, he glared at
Herman and me. ‘What was the idea of all
the cops tarryhootin’ around the house
last night?’ he demanded. 'None of you
bothered to leave a bottle of water beside
my bed. Do you ever realize what it cost
for a thirsty man to look for water in the
dining room last night?', he complained.
He had us there.

Charlie Chaplin was born on April
16, 1889, in London England. His birth
name was Charles Spencer Chaplin,
though he had many nicknames growing
up such as Charlie, Charlot, and The
Little Tramp. His father, Charles Chaplin,
and his mother, Hannah Chaplin, were
inducted into the music hall of fame,
leading the way to his exposure even as
a young boy. His first onstage moment
was when he was 5 years old; he sang a
song that was intended to be sung by his
own mother; she had become ill at the time of the performance, so little Charlie
Chaplin stood instead and performed for
his mother.

Charlie Chaplin came to the United
States in 1910, at the age of 21. He was
brought to New York, which was known
to be a great place to start out for anyone
trying to become a professional actor. Two
years later, in 1913, Chaplin signed his very
first contract at Keystone and it was no
time before he headed to Hollywood. His
first movie premiered in 1914, “Making
a Living,” and went on to make over 35
movies total in that year alone. Charlie
Chaplin grew to become one of the most
popular and successful actors of all time.
The moment that really kicked off his long
career was in 1921 when he starred in, and
produced, his first full length film called
“The Kid.” From then on, most people all 
over the world knew Charlie Chaplin and
loved his movies. He had a great career and
life, dying on December 25, 1977, in Vevey,
Switzerland. He had apparently died of
natural causes in his sleep from old age.

##Reading

**Read the following incident carefully to
answer the questions that follow**

**The Tie that does not Bind**

“Oh, so you’re going abroad? Can
you bring me back…..?” I’ve been asked
to bring back a vaccine for a course. Once
I searched the suburbs of Paris for two
days for a special brand of ceramic paint.
Having spent a lot of money for Cartier
lighter refills, I had them confiscated at
the airport just before boarding because
the gas might be dangerous in the air.

Now, two months before a trip, I stop
talking to people so they won’t suspect
I’m about to travel. But someone always
catches me.” I’ve heard you’re going to
New York, and I want you to get something
for me. It’s just a little thing you can find
anywhere. I don’t know exactly how much
it costs, but it shouldn’t be much. We’ll
settle up when you get back”

What Gilson asked me to buy was, in
fact a little thing: a tie. But not just any tie.
He wanted a tie with a small embroidered
G. Any colour would do, as long as it had
his initial. Look , this is a special flight, I
explained . We are only staying Saturday
through Tuesday. On the day we arrived
I didn’t have time to think about the tie,
but strolling around on Sunday I did see ties bearing various letters in more than
one shop window. They were cheap, just a
dollar, but all the shops were closed. 

On Monday, lunch lasted the whole
afternoon. Then it was Tuesday morning,
time to leave. It was only when I saw our
airport bus waiting outside the hotel that I
remembered the tie.

I told the group to go on. I would get a
taxi to the airport. And so I went in search
of a nearby shop where I had seen ties.

But I couldn’t find it. I walked
further down the street-one, two, three
blocks - all in vain. Back at the hotel, a bit
anxious now, I took my suitcase, got a taxi
and asked the driver to rush to the street
where I had seen them.

The driver stopped at each shop we
passed so I could look from the window.
The stores had all sorts of ties, but not the
kind I was looking for.

When I finally thought I had located
the right shop, I decided to go in and
check. The driver refused to wait. Parking
was prohibited, he said. I promised to
double the fare, jumped out and ran into
the shop. Was I going to miss the plane
just for a damned tie?

The salesman was unbearably slow.
When I realized that the smallest change
I had was a ten dollar note , I grabbed ten
ties of different colours so I wouldn’t have
to wait for change. I rushed out with the
ties in a paper bag

On the street I looked around. The
taxi had vanished, taking my suitcase.
What is more, I was going to miss the
plane

I ran to the corner, and hope flared
up again: the taxi was waiting in the
next street. Quick to the airport! As I
settled down inside the taxi. I sighed with
relief. Gilson was going to have enough
initialized ties to last him a lifetime.

When I reached the airport, I paid
the taxi driver the double fare and grabbed
my suitcase. Panting, I boarded the plane
under the reproachful gaze of the other
passengers, all primly seated with their seat
belts fastened. Ready to take off. Departure
had been delayed because of me.

“At least I hope you found your tie”,
said one who knew the story.

“I did”, I answered triumphantly.

After making myself comfortable, I
reached for the paper bag to show the ties. 

I had left it behind; in the taxi.
